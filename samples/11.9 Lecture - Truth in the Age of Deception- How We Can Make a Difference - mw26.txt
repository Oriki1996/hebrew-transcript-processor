Up until now, we heard how governments, tech companies, journalists, and NGOs are tackling misinformation. But there's a crucial player left, us, the people who consume and share information. At the end of the day, every forward of messages, every retweet, every click, it's individual people making those choices.

We are simultaneously the victims of misinformation, and inadvertent accomplices in spreading it. Any lasting solution has to address human nature. Our cognitive biases, emotional triggers, and gas in media literacy that make false information so appealing at times.

The good news is, once we are aware of these vulnerabilities, we can actively counteract them. This lecture is about how you, as students, citizens, digital natives, can fight misinformation in your own daily life, from your social media feeds to family group chats. Let's start by acknowledging something important.

Falling for misinformation does not mean you're dumb or bad at the internet. It means you're human. As we saw earlier in the semester, our brains are wired in ways that misinformation exploits brilliantly.

We've learned about our own biases, and why we are so susceptible to lies, and why we feel we need to spread them. Also, the article you just read presents that across all countries, the psychological factors underlying the misinformation challenge are quite similar. So what can we do, given that our own brains can be traitors to truth?

To begin with, we must adopt a practical media literacy. What does it mean? For starters, use SIFT, a meta-digital literacy expert Mike Caulfield created.

SIFT is S-I-F-T. S stands for stop. Don't share or act on a piece of content the moment you see it.

Pause, especially if it really triggers some emotion. Scammers and fake news creators want you to react instantly. If each person took a moment to stop and verify before forwarding, the chain would break.

I stands for investigate the source. Check the account or site that published it. Have you heard of them?

Are they who they say they are? A quick Google search might reveal if it's a known satire site or a partisan outlet. If an image is circulating, try to reverse image search using Google Lens to see if it appeared elsewhere in another context.

You might discover that dramatic photo that you just saw of yesterday's protest is actually from a different country many years ago, a common misinformation trick. And when in doubt, go to the professionals. There are excellent fact-checking websites where you can search keywords to see if a claim has been checked.

Snoops, PoliFact, FactCheck, Botkim, and many more. Make it a habit. If something sounds a bit fishy or too dramatic, copy it into Google, right next to it, FactCheck, and hit search.

You'll frequently get instant clarity. If the claim hasn't been fact-checked yet, that's when you must rely on your own critical analysis. The letter F stands for find better coverage.

If it's a claim of something significant, sensational, see if any other major newsletters or trusted national local sources are also repeating it. If a story appears across ideologically diverse outlets, it's more likely that it's solid. If it only exists in one partisan babble, question why the others aren't touching it.

Maybe it's baseless. For breaking news, remember initial reports can be wrong. A rule of thumb, the more extraordinary the claim, the more you should seek independent confirmation.

As the saying attributed to astrophysicist Carl Sagan goes, extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. Finally, the letter T stands for trace to the original. Internet posts often strip context.

Maybe someone tweeted a sensational quote, but did they link the full interview or report it came from? If not, try to trace it. Read the full article or watch the entire video before sharing a snippet.

Many false impressions come from those clips that are cut out of context. Tracing back can also reveal if something is satire that's gone taken seriously down the line. For example, a satirical piece from The Onion, a satirical newspaper, might be shared later by someone who doesn't realize it's a joke.

Now that we have focused on ourselves and our own habits, let us zoom out to our community. How can we be agents for truth? There are many things you can do.

First, whenever you are active, be it your family's WhatsApp group, a college class, an online forum of your favorite team, become the voice that asks, can you send me the source on that? When you encourage people to verify before sharing, you help build a habit of skepticism and critical thinking. Second, another thing you can do is pre-bunking your friends.

This means that if you learn about a certain scam or false story trending elsewhere, warn your circle before it hits them. For instance, if you see, hey, there's a tweet going around claiming 10 soldiers died today. It's not true.

The army says it's an Iranian bot. If you see it, please do not spread it. This way you're acting like a personal fact checker for your network.

They might start doing the same. Third, we should celebrate those who change their minds in light of new facts. In polarized times like we live today, admitting an error is often ridiculed, but it's very courageous.

When someone drops a conspiracy theory and says, I was wrong, that's worth supporting. These stories challenge the myth that people don't change, offering hope and may serve as a blueprint for other people. Fourth, approach people with empathy.

Like we saw in the funny video on birds, telling people they are stupid will not make them change their minds. If a friend or a relative shares questionable information, don't ignore it. Instead, send a private message like, I saw your post and I was concerned it might be false, so I checked it out.

Here's what I found. This non-confrontational approach shows empathy and provides the correct information without shaming them. A one-on-one conversation works better than publicly fact-checking them, especially with older relatives that are new to the internet.

I know that constant exposure to misinformation can be mentally exhausting, leading to infodemic fatigue. It's okay to take breaks from doom-scrolling and focus on offline hobbies. You don't need to correct every false post.

Choose your battles with your own mental health. Stepping back can restore some perspective. On a positive note, each of us can make a difference.

You don't need to be an expert to slow the spread of falsehoods. Small actions like not sharing unverified posts or helping a friend verify information can create a ripple effect. Over time, these actions can shift societal norms and encourage critical thinking in our own communities.

Things can improve. Remember how, just a few years ago, countless people fell for scams from a Nigerian prince promising millions in exchange for bank details? Over time, we learned to recognize these scams and now most people on the planet know how to avoid them.

We need to reach that same point with misinformation. Instilling a deep skepticism for anything that seems off and fostering a society that is both media illiterate and intolerant of deception. A few years ago, my father, remember him?

The one who forced me to eat the vegetables? Well, he would bombard me with all kinds of crazy posts, each one more outlandish than the last. I'd respond with a simple, that's fake.

But soon I realized that wasn't enough. Instead of just pointing out that it's misinformation, I decided to turn it into an opportunity to educate him. I'd walk him through the checkbook in sources, referring to fact-checking organizations, and teach him how to question what he saw.

It wasn't long before I noticed a shift. The messages started to dwindle. My father, who once had minimal media literacy, became a much more discerning consumer of information.

Today, I rarely get those wild posts anymore. He's been cured. And if I could help an 86-year-old person who has little media literacy to navigate the maze of misinformation, I believe anyone can be cured if they are willing to take the medicine.

Looking back at this semester, we've seen how pervasive misinformation is and how vulnerable we are to its influence. We've explored how politicians, the media, social media, new technologies often exacerbate this challenge. Yet despite this overwhelming landscape of lies, one thing remains clear.

Knowledge is power. And through this course, I believe I've equipped you with the tools to discern truth from falsehood, which I hope will serve you well in the real world. While we may never completely rid the world of misinformation, we can certainly reduce its hold.

Each person who commits to becoming a discerning consumer and an honest share of information acts like an immune cell in a society's body, detecting and responding to the virus of falsehoods. The more people who take this stance, the stronger and healthier our society becomes. Ultimately, fighting misinformation is about preserving the fabric of our shared reality.

It's about ensuring that despite our differences, we can still agree on the basic fact that underpins our conversations, decisions, and actions. Trust, trust in information, in our institutions, and in each other is the foundation of our society. Without it, we cannot function.

With it, we can thrive. That trust is worth defending. The truth, while sometimes fragile, is more resilient than we often give it credit for.

If we nurture it, it will endure. We all have a role to play in this, and together we can make sure truth has a fighting chance. Thank you for your attention and for your commitment to being part of the solution.

Stay curious, stay critical, and above all, stay hopeful. The fight is difficult, but with your involvement, truth has a fighting chance. Take care.

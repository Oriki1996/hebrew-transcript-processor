Hi again, in 2016, a bizarre conspiracy theory known as Pizzagate emerged from the dark corners of the internet. It claimed that top American politicians and celebrities were running a secret child trafficking ring out of a Washington DC pizzeria. The story spread like wildfire across social media, fueled by cryptic evidence pieced together from hacked emails and misinterpreted symbols.

For some, this was misinformation shared by those who genuinely believed they were exposing aid and truth. For others, particularly those amplifying the story on extremist forums, it was disinformation, a deliberate false narrative designated to manipulate and enrage. The consequences were anything but theoretical.

A man, convinced by what he read online, drove from North Carolina all the way to the restaurant in Washington DC, armed with an assault rifle, determined to rescue children from where they were never there. He fired a shot inside before surrendering to police. The incident highlighted the real-world danger of unchecked falsehoods and underscored the importance of distinguishing between misinformation, disinformation, propaganda, and plain lies, concepts that shape our understanding of truth and deception in ways that have far-reaching consequences.

Let us start with misinformation. Misinformation is, at its core, false or misleading information spread without intent to deceive. It is the mistaken retelling of facts, the urban legend that just won't die, the misquoted statistic passed around in good faith.

Think of your uncle or grandma on Facebook, earnestly sharing a claim that drinking water after eating a watermelon can make you sick, a claim unsupported by science but circulating because many people feel it is true. One of history's most notorious cases of misinformation occurred in 1938 when Orson Welles performed a radio adaptation of H.G. Wells' The World of the Words on CBS. The broadcast structured a series of realistic breaking news updates described an unfolding Martian invasion landing in New Jersey.

The show was clearly announced as a dramatization at the beginning, but many listeners tuned in late, missing the opening disclaimer. Some listeners, unfamiliar with radio dramas, mistook the performance for a real emergency of Martians landing on Earth. While actual panic was not as widespread as later reports claimed, scattered instances of alarm did occur, police stations received worried calls, and some people reportedly packed their cars and fled from cities to rural areas.

In daily life, misinformation thrives in casual conversations. When I was a young boy, someone, maybe my older sister, told me that if I swallowed the pit of a peach, a tree would grow out of my head. Since that day, I became extremely cautious eating fruits, even apples, and of course I shared this important information with all the other kids in kindergarten, and just like that, a new piece of misinformation spreads.

Because it sounds just possibly enough, nobody questions it, and let's be honest, a tiny tree sprouting from your skull is a fantastic visual. Misinformation is often difficult to correct because it taps into the emotions like fear, hope, anger, and once embedded, it can be resistant to facts. But it differs from disinformation in a crucial way.

It lacks malicious intent. So where misinformation is often accidental, disinformation is deliberate. It is false information spread with the intent to deceive, to mislead, or manipulate.

Disinformation is the chosen tool of intelligence agencies, political operatives, and digital age trolls. The KGB's operation, Infection, remains one of the most famous disinformation campaigns in the 20th century. In the 1980s, Soviet intelligence planted a false story in an Indian newspaper claiming that the United States has created AIDS as a biological weapon.

This story was ignored at first, but slowly it gained traction, appearing in various international publications before creeping into the mainstream discussions. By the time the U.S. officials scrambled to debunk it, the damage was done. To this day, some people still believe this conspiracy theory, proving that well-crafted disinformation has an astonishingly long life.

If disinformation plays a role in world affairs, they are even more prevalent in political campaigns. Few political disinformation campaigns have been as persistent as the claim that Barack Obama wasn't born in the United States, a lie that Donald Trump himself pushed for years. It started during the 2008 election, when fringe websites and political operatives claimed that Obama was born in Kenya and therefore is ineligible to be U.S. President. Despite Hawaiian officials verifying his birth certificate, the birther conspiracy kept spreading and spreading, fueled by viral emails, right-wing media, and eventually Trump himself, who publicly questioned Obama's birthplace for years. The campaign was pure disinformation. Its architects knew it was false, but they spread it anyway to cast doubts on Obama's legitimacy.

It successfully convinced millions of Americans that Obama was a foreigner, proving how repeated disinformation can override facts. Propaganda, unlike disinformation, is not necessarily false. Instead, it is information, or sometimes a mix of truth and lies, designed to shape opinions, stir emotions, and promote a particular agenda.

Few figures in history mastered the art of propaganda as effectively as Joseph Goebbels, Hitler's minister of propaganda. The Nazi regime used films, posters, newspapers, and radio broadcasts to systematically spread anti-Semitic narratives, portraying Jews as enemies of the German people. Goebbels' propaganda machine blamed Jews for Germany's economic troubles, depicted them as subhuman, and accused them of conspiring against the nation.

This relentless campaign of dehumanization, which included films like The Eternal Jew, paved the way for the Holocaust, demonstrating how propaganda, when weaponized effectively, doesn't just shape opinions, it can even enable atrocities. Propaganda isn't just a relic of the past, it's alive and well in modern politics. Donald Trump's 2015 campaign announcement speech is a prime example of how propaganda can shape public perceptions by framing an entire group as a threat.

In that speech, Trump declared that, quote, When Mexico sends its people, they're not sending their best. They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime.

They're rapists, unquote. While Trump later added, Some, I assure, are good people, the damage was done. The speech painted Mexican immigrants as dangerous criminals, reinforcing fears that would become a central theme of his presidency.

The claim wasn't rooted in any data. It was simply an emotional manipulation, a hallmark of a successful propaganda. It did not matter that research shows that Mexican undocumented immigrants commit fewer crimes than U.S.-born citizens, or that 60% less likely to be incarcerated, 37% less likely to be convicted of a crime. Trump's claims persisted even years later. His words reshaped national debates on immigration, border policy, and xenophobia in the U.S. It is important to understand that the key element of propaganda is that it's about shaping perception rather than simply informing. While disinformation actively spreads falsehoods, propaganda works by framing reality in a particular way.

Now, we move, of course, to plain lies. They're raw, unvarnished falsehoods told with no attempt at sophistication. Lies can be personal, like, I never said that, or word-shaping lies, like, such as the Iraq weapons of mass destruction that we encountered in the previous class.

Unlike misinformation, which can stem from ignorance or propaganda, which manipulates existing truths, lies are the most basic forms of deception, statements made with the full knowledge of their falsehoods. Consider the infamous Dreyfus affair in 19th century France. Captain Alfred Dreyfus, a Jewish officer, was accused of treason based on falsified evidence.

The government, the military, and much of the press knowingly perpetuated the lie, fueling anti-Semitic sentiments and national division. Only after years of relentless advocacy, particularly by writer Émile Zola, did the truth emerge. Not all lies are created equal, however.

Some are harmless, like hiding a diamond ring you plan to give your wife on her anniversary. Other lies fall into the gray area of deception, like when Beyoncé admitted to lip-synching the national anthem at President Obama's inauguration, a move that sparked controversy but had no real consequences. And then there are word-shaking lies, like the infamous Brexit lies.

Ahead of the 2016 Brexit referendum, Great Britain's vote on whether to leave the European Union, pro-Brexit campaigners headed by London Mayor and future Prime Minister Boris Johnson falsely claimed that the UK was sending £350 million per week to the EU and that leaving would allow that money to be redirected to the National Health Service. The claim was plastered on buses, influencing public opinion, only for many campaigners to later admit that it wasn't true. To sum up, while these four definitions provide a framework, the real world is much messier.

In the digital age, lines blur, misinformation and disinformation feed off each other and propaganda is often wrapped in the language of objectivity. The internet has made it easier than ever to spread deception, whether intentional or not. Take the Pizzagate scandal itself.

What started as a deliberate disinformation soon became misinformation, re-shared by people who genuinely believed they were exposing a hidden evil. What was once an online conspiracy became a real-world event, proving that falsehoods don't just spread, they evolve. I'll see you next week.

Take care.

Welcome back. This information comes in many shapes and sizes. Sometimes it's as simple as false as a newspaper headline claiming Elvis is alive, just to sell more newspapers.

Or a photoshopped image making a politician look younger, like the case of Wang Ziya, a Taiwanese politician running for a position on Taipei City Council. Other times it can be far more consequential, such as fabricating electoral results to seal the election, like Nicolas Maduro did in Venezuela in 2025. But perhaps the most astonishing form of disinformation is persuading people to leave behind all they believed in and embrace a completely new religion, one that you just made up.

Case in point, Joseph Smith, a young man from upstate New York who claimed divine visions and unearthed sacred texts, convincing millions to follow his spiritual movement. Let's take a trip back in time to the early 19th century, an era of religious upheaval in America. With church attendance low, charismatic preachers roamed the countryside, stirring up religious fervor.

Beyond religion, people in upstate New York, where Smith lived, were looking for treasures they believed pirates, Indians, or Spanish explorers buried in the woods. The search was done using magical methods like seer stones or divining rods. So at this time, that's when we have a young man, rowing in the woods, seeking treasures and God, and at the age of 14, Joseph claims that while praying in the woods, he experienced a vision in which God and Jesus Christ appeared, telling him that all the other churches were untrue to the world of God.

A few years later, he reported another visitation, this time from an angel named Moroni, who revealed the existence of a hidden book inscribed on golden plates buried nearby. At the age of 21, he finally found the plates, using a mix of traditional methods and divine inspiration, he dictates their context to scribes. Sometimes he placed special stones in a hat, claiming the words appear on them, which he then read out loud.

The result of this process was the Book of Mormon, a scripture that he had his followers regarded as an ancient record of the divine testament. As for the golden plates, no one has seen them except for Joseph Smith till this day. What is the book about?

It is too much to cover here, but here's a little taste of it. It tells the story of Jews from Jerusalem that around the year 600 BC, just before the destruction of the first temple, are told by God to pack up, wander on the desert, possibly making a stop in Oman, and then, in a bold move, build a boat. After what must have been like the world's worst cruise ever, they land somewhere in the Americas.

Exact location? Somewhere not really clear. Shortly after they arrive to America, they begin fighting and they split into two tribes, the Nephites, the good guys, and the Lamanites, who are claimed the ancestors of the Native American tribes.

That phrasing has since been tweaked by the church to say they're among the ancestors. The most important part of the story is that following Jesus' crucifixion, he comes to the Americas to visit these tribes. He gets them to stop fighting, at least for a few centuries, until the Nephites do wicked things and the Lamanites destroy them.

For this action, God darkens their skin, and that's why they are the Indians. While the Book of Mormon completed, Smith formally established his church in 1830. Smith, who is now 25 years old, attracted dedicated followers who saw him as a prophet restoring the true faith, preparing for the second coming of Christ.

Unlike mainstream Christianity, his theology introduced novel ideas. God had a physical body and a divine wife, humans were eternal beings who could achieve godhood ourselves, and then the faithful needed specific rituals and authority to attain salvation. Smith's teachings mixed traditional Christian beliefs with folk magic, Jewish mysticism, and even elements of Freemasonry.

His movement grew rapidly, but also faced intense opposition. Persecuted and expelled from multiple communities, his followers remained committed to the vision of a divine-guided society. Ultimately, Joseph Smith laid the foundation for a faith that has today 7 million followers in the United States and about 10 million more worldwide.

Now let's take a step back and reflect on how we view religious origins. We often scrutinize newer faiths like Mormonism or Scientology with skepticism, questioning the plausibility of their miraculous claims. But why do we do so readily accept extraordinary events of older religions like Moses parting the seas, Jesus being born out of a virgin, or Muhammad riding Burak, a flying horse, without the same level of doubt?

A few years ago, a student asked famous evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins, what if you are wrong and there is God? To this, Dawkins replied as follows, well, what if I'm wrong? Anyone could be wrong.

We could all be wrong about the flying spaghetti monster, the pink unicorn, or the celestial teapot. The point is, belief is often a matter of cultural accident. You were raised in the Christian faith, or in our case, the Jewish faith, or the Muslim faith, which means you already know what it's like not to believe in other religions.

You're not a Muslim or a Hindu. And why not? Because you weren't raised in India, where you'd probably be a Hindu, or in Saudi Arabia, where you'd likely be a Muslim.

Had you been born in Denmark during the Viking era, you'd believe in Odin and Thor. In classical Greece, you'd worship Zeus. In Central Africa, it might be the great Juju of the mountain.

There's no particular reason to single out the Judeo-Christian God, whom you happen to believe in purely by the accident of birth, and ask me, meaning Richard Dawkins, what if you're wrong? The same question could be asked of you. What if you're wrong about the great Juju at the bottom of the sea?

Richard Dawkins and I, for that matter, are not asking you to abandon your faith. Our aim is simply to highlight the distinction between believing and knowing. Everyone has the right to believe in the deity of their choice.

The problem arises only when belief hardens into an absolute conviction that one's own God is the only true God, and all the others are false. Around the world, there are about 3,000 deities, 3,000 gods. Chances are you don't believe in 2,999 of them, and that's perfectly fine.

An atheist is simply someone who goes one god further. As you sit back and watch in the next short clip from South Park about Joseph Smith and the creation of the Mormon faith, ask yourself, what makes one faith more believable than another? How much of our acceptance depends on tradition rather than evidence?

And more generally, what is the difference between believing and knowing? I hope you enjoyed. See you next time.

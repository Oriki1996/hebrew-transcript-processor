[דובר 3] (0:00 - 0:11)
Alright kids, now how about we do some scripture readings from the Book of Mormon! The Book of Mormon? What's that?

The book that Joseph Smith found! Who's Joseph Smith? Tell us the story of Joseph Smith again, Dad!

[דובר 4] (0:12 - 0:22)
Joseph Smith was called a prophet, dum-dum-dum-dum-dum He started the Mormon religion, dum-dum-dum-dum-dum You know, he claims he spoke with God and Jesus.

[דובר 8] (0:22 - 0:24)
Well, how do you know he didn't?

[דובר 1] (0:24 - 0:41)
Dum-dum-dum-dum-dum Joseph, I told my wife that you spoke with God and she didn't believe it! Well, it's true, I did! Where?

I was asking God if I should be a Protestant, or a Catholic, or what? And suddenly, God and Jesus appeared before me! And they said I should start my own church!

You see?

[דובר 7] (0:41 - 0:44)
You believe it now? Well, yeah, sure, why would he make that up?

[דובר 4] (0:45 - 0:53)
Dum-dum-dum-dum-dum And that night he saw an angel Dum-dum-dum-dum-dum I am Moroni.

[דובר 5] (0:54 - 0:56)
I am a Native American.

[דובר 1] (0:56 - 0:57)
But your skin is white!

[דובר 5] (0:57 - 1:17)
Yes, long ago all Native Americans were white. We all came to America from Jerusalem. And while we were here, we were visited by Christ.

Eventually, my people were all killed by the other tribe of Israel. And as punishment, God turned their skin red. Dum-dum-dum-dum-dum Wow!

[דובר 4] (1:18 - 1:26)
Dum-dum-dum-dum-dum Joseph Smith was called a prophet Dum-dum-dum-dum-dum Hey, Dad, how come you never told me about Joseph Smith?

[דובר 3] (1:27 - 1:38)
Who? The guy who spoke to God and Jesus. Well, Stan, God and Jesus don't actually speak to people.

That's not what the Harrison said. Mr. Harrison said that Joseph Smith spoke to God and Jesus and they told him none of the religions were right.

[דובר 2] (1:38 - 1:40)
Oh, did he now?

[דובר 3] (1:40 - 1:43)
Mr. Harrison said that I need to be following Heavenly Father's plan and I don't even know what that is.

[דובר 2] (1:44 - 1:59)
All right, that does it. I'm gonna go have a talk with this Mr. Harrison. If he thinks he can fill my son's head with wacko religious crap, he's wrong.

I'm gonna go kick this Mr. Harrison's ass. Mr. Harrison is a white guy, right?

[דובר 3] (2:00 - 2:00)
Yeah.

[דובר 2] (2:00 - 2:02)
Yeah, I'm gonna kick his ass.

[דובר 3] (2:06 - 2:06)
Hello!

[דובר 2] (2:07 - 2:12)
Yeah, are you Mr. Harrison? I sure am. My kid was just over at your house and he, uh...

[דובר 9] (2:12 - 2:15)
Oh, you're Stan's dad! It's so nice to finally meet you!

[דובר 2] (2:15 - 2:20)
Well, thanks, uh... Karen just finished baking the most amazing Rice Krispie Squares.

[דובר 8] (2:20 - 2:21)
With chocolate frosting.

[דובר 2] (2:21 - 2:36)
Come on out of the cold. You gotta try one. Or six.

You know, to be honest, I've never known any Mormons. I don't even know what you people believe. Who was this Joseph Smith guy?

Why did he believe that Native Americans were actually white people from Jerusalem?

[דובר 1] (2:36 - 3:15)
I found them! I found them! You're not gonna believe it, everybody!

I found them! Found what? Another New Testament of Jesus Christ!

I dug around all morning where the angel had told me to look. Wow! Inside the stone box, I found the magical seer stones.

Under that, I found four gold plates written in strange writing. So where are they? Where are what?

The gold plates and the seer stones. Where are they? The angel Moroni appeared to me again.

And said that I am not allowed to show the plates or the seer stones to anybody. Because first I must translate what's written on the plates into English.

[דובר 4] (3:15 - 3:30)
Dum-dum-dum-dum-dum He found the stones and golden plates Dum-dum-dum-dum-dum Even though nobody else ever saw them Dum-dum-dum-dum-dum Sharon, did you know this guy Joseph Smith found a New Testament to the Bible buried here in America?

[דובר 2] (3:30 - 3:42)
What are you talking about? Well, it's just that the Harrisons are really nice people and you should see how loving and together their family is. I think there's something to that religion.

From now on, our family is Mormon!

[דובר 3] (3:43 - 4:05)
Hey, Stan! Oh, here's Stan's little girlfriend now! Hey, guys!

Stan, I remember you said last night that you'd lost your wallet so I made you a new one. Aw, look at them. Aren't they so cute together?

So, hey, I heard your dad came over last night and he and my dad talked about Joseph Smith. That's great! What happened after he found the golden plates buried in the ground?

Well, he kept them hidden from everyone like he was told and then he translated what was written on the plates into the Book of Mormon.

[דובר 7] (4:06 - 4:19)
Dum-dum-dum-dum-dum What's this all about, Mr. Smith? I have, in my possession, an ancient book written on gold plates that tells of Jesus Christ's Second Coming here, in America! In America?

[דובר 2] (4:19 - 4:26)
Really? That sounds kind of... Dum-dum-dum-dum-dum How do you expect to translate it?

[דובר 1] (4:26 - 4:45)
With these. With them, God allows me to translate the plates into English. You take this quill and paper and write down what I say.

Sit here. I have the golden plates here in this hat. I need to have them somewhere dark so I can read the spiritual light.

Oh, okay, write this down. Christ appeared before the Nephites.

[דובר 4] (4:46 - 4:52)
And that's how the Book of Mormon was written. Dum-dum-dum-dum-dum Ooh, that must be the Harrisons.

[דובר 2] (4:55 - 5:12)
Hey, everybody! Wow, what a great house! Well, come on in and sit down, everybody.

You're here just in time. My son was having a little problem with our new religion. Dad?

Well, that's just because he hasn't heard the best part about the Joseph Smith story. The one that proves he was for real.

[דובר 4] (5:12 - 5:18)
Martin went home to his wife. Dum-dum-dum-dum-dum And showed her pages from the Book of Mormon.

[דובר 8] (5:18 - 5:25)
Dum-dum-dum-dum-dum Martin, how do you know he isn't just making stuff up and pretending he's translating off golden plates?

[דובר 6] (5:26 - 5:31)
Lucy Harris smart, smart, smart Smart, smart, smart, smart, smart I'm gonna hide these pages.

[דובר 8] (5:32 - 5:36)
If Joseph Smith really is translating off of golden plates, then he'll be able to do it again.

[דובר 6] (5:36 - 5:50)
Lucy Harris smart, smart, smart Martin Harris dumb So Martin went on back to Smith Said the pages had gone away Look, I'm sorry about losing the pages we worked on, Joe, but I'm ready to write it all down again if you translate from the plates.

[דובר 9] (5:50 - 5:54)
The Lord said he is very angry with me for letting you take those pages.

[דובר 1] (5:54 - 6:04)
He is? Dum-dum-dum-dum-dum He said we must now translate from the plate of Nephi. So it will be the same basic story, but written a little differently.

[דובר 9] (6:05 - 6:10)
Wow! If God got angry with you, then you must be telling the truth.

[דובר 3] (6:10 - 6:17)
Dum-dum-dum-dum-dum-dum-dum Wait, Mormons actually know this story and they still believe Joseph Smith was a prophet? Well, sure.

[דובר 2] (6:17 - 6:19)
The story proves it, doesn't it?

[דובר 3] (6:19 - 6:21)
No, it proves he did make it all up. Are you blind?

[דובר 2] (6:22 - 6:24)
Hey, Stan, don't denounce our religion.

[דובר 3] (6:24 - 6:46)
I don't want to be Mormon, Dad. Me neither. Hey, that's totally cool, guys.

You can believe whatever you want. Oh, stop it! That's another thing.

You just weasel people into your way of thinking by acting like the happiest family in the world and being so nice to everyone that you just blindside dumb people like my dad! Yeah! Hey, Stan.

Oh, brother. Uh-oh, the jilted lover returns.

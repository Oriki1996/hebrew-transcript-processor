Hi there, in this lecture we'll be diving into one of the most ancient, complex, and deeply personal questions. Why do people believe in God? Belief in God, or gods, is something most humans share, with about 85% of the world identifying with religion.

This lecture isn't about proving or disproving anything. My goal is not to question someone's faith or promote atheism. This is about understanding belief, why belief is so powerful and persistent.

By looking at why people believe, we'll get a clearer view of how emotions, trust, and meaning can sometimes outweigh facts, and why that matters when we talk about misinformation. Let's break it down. Picture a human being 50,000 years ago, walking along through the dense forest.

Suddenly, a branch snaps. Is it just the wind, or is it a tiger? Better safe than sorry, right?

Evolution shaped our brains to detect agency, to assume that behind every sound, every movement, or every event, there might be an intentional force at work. It's the same instinct that makes us see faces in the clouds or check our phones when they didn't actually buzz. This reflex doesn't stop at small things.

It easily extends to bigger forces. We see purpose and intention not just in rustling branches or in storms, disease, even in the movements of the stars. It's from this powerful mental habit that the idea of gods likely emerges.

And there's more. Our minds are wired for teleological thinking, a natural tendency to ask, what's it for? Even young children intuitively believe that mountains exist, so perhaps animals can climb them.

This way of thinking makes us feel natural, even obvious, to imagine a divine purpose behind the world. On top of that, we experience mind-body dualism, the strong sense that the mind is something separate from the physical body. Once you believe that the mind can exist without our body, it's a small step to believe in invisible, powerful beings who shape our world.

Taken together, these are deep evolutionary reasons why belief in God feels so intuitive to so many people. If you do not believe me, evidence found by Israeli archaeologists shows that our ancestors may have believed in life after death as far as 92,000 years ago. In the Dumim cave near Nazareth, humans buried their dead with red orc and symbol objects that the dead may take to the next life.

Over in Shanidar cave in Iraq, Neanderthals were buried with what appears to be flowers. These weren't just practical burials, they were rituals, acts of reverence, possibly early signs that humans believed death was not the end. Now let's talk about where we grow up.

Most people are introduced to the idea of God before they can even read. It's part of lullabies, holiday dinners, bedtime prayers, and stories about what happens when grandma dies. Culture reinforces belief.

It's in our language. God bless you, an act of God, in God we trust. National holidays, moral traditions, wedding vows, all wrapped in religious language.

Even non-believers grow up soaked in these ideas. In many Muslim communities, the very first words a newborn hears are the adham, the Islamic call to prayer, whispered in their ear usually by their father or a close male relative. This isn't just a ritual.

It's a cultural initiation into faith and belonging. The words Allahu Akbar, God is great, are among the first sounds that touch the child's ears even before they fully open to the world. From there, God is everywhere.

In daily greetings like Inshallah, God willing, or Alhamdulillah, praise to be God. In lullabies, bedtime stories, and even in holiday celebrations. Children grow up not just hearing about God, but feeling woven into a community where belief is in the air that they breathe.

In such settings, belief isn't just personal. It's cultural, relational, communal. Even those who question faith later in life often feel that stepping away from belief means stepping outside the fabric of family, identity, and home.

And in many places, belief in God is part of belonging, where your whole community believes it feels risky to step outside of that. Belief in God often offers something deeply personal, comfort. When you lose someone or get a diagnosis or feel like life is just spinning out of control, the idea that there's a higher power in guiding you, things can be very comforting.

The thought of an afterlife soothes the fear of death. The idea that everything happens for a reason can soften the sharp edges of chaos. In the Bhagavad Gita, one of the most sacred texts of Hinduism, a warrior, Arjuna, breaks down before a battle, overwhelmed by fear and grief at the thought of fighting his own relatives.

He feels powerless and lost until Krishna reveals a deeper truth. The soul is eternal, duty must be followed, and all is part of a divine order. Krishna tells him, you have the right to perform your duty, but not to the fruits of your actions.

This comforts Arjuna and gives him the strength to carry on. To this day, many Hindus turn to the Gita in times of crisis, finding peace in the belief that God is guiding the chaos. This is why psychology is called compensatory control.

When we feel powerless, we reach for structures that restore order. For many, God is that structure. Another driving force for faith is that humans are meaning makers.

We want to know, where did we come from? Why are we here? What happens when we die?

Religions offer beautifully packaged answers to those questions, answers that often sound more comforting than what science and facts have to offer. But it's not just about seeking explanations. Sometimes it's about experiencing something that words cannot explain, an awe.

That overwhelming feeling that when you see the northern lights, when you hear a baby's heartbeat for the first time, or stand beneath the arches of a vast cathedral, that can make the presence of something greater feel undeniable. On Christmas Eve 1968, Apollo 8 astronauts became the first humans to orbit the moon and saw Earth rise over the lunar horizon, a fragile blue sphere in the vast dark. Moved by the sight, Bill Anders took the iconic Earthrise photo.

During their live broadcast, the crew, not especially religious, read from the book of Genesis, In the beginning God created heaven and the earth. Reaching for ancient words, they gave voice to an awe mystery of the moment. Whether it is divine, the universe, or a mystery of consciousness, awe pulls us towards the transcendence.

Now some people believe because they felt something, a presence during meditation, a dream that changed them, a moment of peace in crisis when they felt the supernatural. Others point to answered prayers or to improbable events that felt too timely to be chance. Whether you call them miracles, synchronicities, or simply emotional truths, these personal moments can be deeply persuasive.

Even if someone else might explain them differently to the person who experiences them, they can feel like a direct contact with the divine. Before a decisive battle to become sole ruler of the Roman Empire, Emperor Constantine, who was a pagan, reportedly saw a vision of a cross in the sky with the words, In hoc signo, winces. Or in English, in this sign, conquer.

He later claimed Christ came to him in a dream, instructing him to fight under the Christian symbol. He won the battle, converted to Christianity, and went on to legalize and promote the Christian faith across the empire, massively shaping Western religious history. Similarly, thousands of people report turning to faith after near-death experiences.

A famous case is Dr. Ibn Alexander, a neurosurgeon who was previously skeptical of religion. After a week-long coma during which he experienced what he interpreted as a journey to the afterlife, he became convinced of God's existence and wrote Proof of Heaven. Religion doesn't just tell us where we come from.

It tells us how to live. For many, God provides moral clarity, what's right, what's wrong, and why it matters. And if you believe in God is watching, and that actions have eternal consequences, ones that can lead you to heaven or to hell, that can be a powerful motivator to do good, even when no one else is looking.

We call this the supernatural monitoring hypothesis. It's like having a cosmic security camera beamed at you. And this idea has been tested even with little children.

In one experiment, researchers introduced four-year-old kids to an invisible character called Princess Alice, who could see everything. Guess what? The kids were significantly less likely to cheat in a game when they thought the invisible princess was sitting next to them.

Just the idea of an unseen observer changes behavior. Now imagine that's scaled up to entire societies. That's the power of belief in a watchful God.

Fate is very personal, but let's not forget belief often comes wrapped in community. Rituals, songs, potlucks, weddings, funerals, shared language, these things bind people together. They create an identity.

And when life gets hard, your faith community is often first with food and some comfort. Alain de Botton is an atheist philosopher who argues that religion offers something secular life often lacks, community, ritual, and emotional support. Though he doesn't believe in God, he sees great value in how religious institutions bring people together, offer moral guidance, and mark life's big moments.

Drawing from religion as a community, he called for the creation of atheism 2.0, keeping the structure and warmth of religion without the supernatural beliefs. In that way, belief isn't just vertical, meaning between you and God, it's horizontal, meaning that it's between you and everyone who shares your belief and your community. To conclude, belief in God is not just one thing.

It's a tapestry woven from evolution, culture, psychology, awe, pain, joy, fear, and hope. For some, it's essential as hair. For others, it's a story that they outgrown.

And for many more, it's a question still unfolding. Whether you believe or not, we all share a passion to understand our place in this vast, mysterious universe. See you soon.

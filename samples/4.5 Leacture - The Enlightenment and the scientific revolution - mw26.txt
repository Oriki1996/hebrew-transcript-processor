Hey, welcome back. In this lecture, we are going to explore one of the most transformative periods in Western civilization, the Enlightenment, also frequently referred to as the Age of Reason. Over the course of this lecture, we will delve into the core tenets of this influential era, spanning roughly from the 1600s to the end of the 1700s.

Our focus will be on the Enlightenment's profound emphasis on reason, its relentless pursuit of knowledge, the remarkable advancement in science, and its complex and often critical engagement with religion. The very name, Enlightenment, signifies time of illumination. This was an era characterized by an influential collective of scholars, writers, artists, and scientists who resultedly sought to employ the clear light of reason.

That is, rational thought, to dispel the shadows of superstition and ignorance that had long held sway in Europe. As a direct consequence of their concerted efforts, the Enlightenment witnessed tremendous improvements in our understanding of mathematics and science, alongside the development of bold new ideas regarding basic human rights and democracy. This revolutionary concept serves as major inspiration for transformative movements all across the world.

To truly grasp the essence of the Enlightenment, we must first acknowledge its roots in the preceding Renaissance and the growing scientific revolution. Near the close of the Renaissance, during the first half of the 17th century, two towering figures emerged whose publications would ignite an intellectual fervor of generations, Francis Bacon in England and René Descartes in France. Many historians rightly consider these two men to be the fathers of the Enlightenment.

Francis Bacon, born in England in 1561, developed many of his key ideas while studying at Cambridge Trinity College. He believed science could free people from ignorance and improve everyday life. But first, the mind had to be liberated from careless, uncritical thinking.

Bacon promoted a rational approach based on careful observation, experimentation, and empirical evidence, rather than relying solely on deductive reasoning like Aristotle. For Bacon, the true purpose of science was to expand human knowledge and enhance life through discovery. Across the English Channel, in France, the brilliant mathematician René Descartes published influential works that proclaimed reason and mathematics as the essential tools for discovering truth in the sciences.

Descartes famously linked the universe to a perfect clock, meticulously designed and constructed by a master clockmaker whom he identified as an all-powerful god, a god who set the universe in motion and then allowed it to operate independently. Descartes sought an unshakable foundation for science, employing doubt as the method to eliminate any ideas that could be false. This rigorous process of questioning led him to his celebrated conclusion, cogito ergo sum, or in English, I think, therefore I am, asserting the undeniable truth of his own existence as a thinking being.

The idea propagated by Descartes and Bacon proved to be immersely significant as they paved the way for the development of what we now call the scientific method. This constitutes a systematic series of simple, rational steps that can be followed to effectively address even the most complex scientific problems. Among the luminaries of the Enlightenment, the great English mathematician and physicist Isaac Newton stands out for the sheer brilliance of his work.

After completing his studies at Trinity College, an outbreak of bubonic plague forced Newton in 1665 to retreat to his own isolated rural home. It was during this relatively brief 18-month period that Isaac Newton experienced an unparalleled burst of scientific insight. He laid the groundwork for a new branch of mathematics known as calculus, made crucial discoveries in optics, and famously understood and mathematically formulated the laws of gravity after observing an apple falling from a tree.

Simultaneously, he formulated the laws of motion. Armed with these groundbreaking scientific laws, Newton was able to precisely calculate the weights of the sun and the planets and to predict the paths of comets. Newton's scientific method, emphasizing careful experiments, logical thinking, and the rejection of unproven ideas, together with the discovery of the universe operating according to natural laws, further solidified the core principles of the Enlightenment's empiricism.

The Enlightenment also witnessed significant advancements in other scientific fields. The study of chemistry, electricity, and biology flourished, with biology experiencing particularly rapid growth due in part to the microscope. Using it, English biologist Robert Hooke observed box-like compartments in plant tissue slices and coined the term cells.

To this day, the term remains in use describing the fundamental building blocks of life. In the mid-1700s, the Swedish botanist Carolus Linnaeus devised a logical method for scientifically classifying, grouping, and naming the Earth's vast area of living organisms, thereby establishing the modern science of taxonomy, or biological classification. During the Age of Reason, individuals like Linnaeus and Newton were known as natural philosophers.

Today, we would just call them scientists. Genuine philosophers, not natural philosophers, made immense contributions to the way we view and understand the world in that period. One of the most influential philosophers of the time was the Englishman John Locke, who lived from 1632 to 1704.

Locke argued that the authority of government to govern must derive from the consent of the people, asserting the principle of popular sovereignty. Locke famously championed the idea that every human being is born with three fundamental rights, the right to life, political equality or liberty, and the ownership of property. Furthermore, Locke advocated for freedom of the press, educational reform, and religious tolerance, and even called for the overthrow of governments that failed to safeguard these basic human rights.

Locke believed that knowledge originates from experience, a concept he termed tabula rasa, or in English, a blank slate, from which our knowledge grows. In France, several prominent Enlightenment philosophers passionately wrote about human rights and democracy. The French philosopher Voltaire, for instance, vigorously championed the concept of freedom of speech, famously stating, I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to my debt your right to say it.

Another Frenchman, Montesquieu, advocated for the complete separation of powers within government, proposing the creation of distinctive legislative, executive, and judicial branches to maintain balance. Nearly all philosophers of the Enlightenment period desired a strict separation of church and state, recognizing the historical propensity for conflict and oppression when government and religion were interwined. The Enlightenment philosophers themselves were often believers, individuals who, while not adhering to traditional religious doctrines, believed in what they termed nature's god, an all-powerful spiritual force that created the universe and everything within it, but thereafter refrained from direct intervention in daily lives.

The Enlightenment's emphasis on empiricism and rationalism naturally led to a critical re-evaluation of religion's role in society. While Christianity in Europe did not vanish, it faced significant challenges as Enlightenment thinkers questioned religious institutions and dogmas. This intellectual scrutiny led to adaptations within Christian thought and the emergence of new religious and secular perspectives.

Deism became a prominent religious idea during the Enlightenment. Deists believed in the existence of god, but maintained that this god did not intervene in the world. They posited that the humans could comprehend god through reason and the observation of nature and its laws, rather than through miracles or religious texts.

They envisioned god as a distant creator who, just like a clockmaker, set the universe in motion and then allowed it to operate according to natural laws. This belief system enabled Enlightenment thinkers to retain a belief in a creator without necessarily adhering to traditional Christian doctrines, thereby reconciling faith with increasing advancements in science and reason. Prominent figures like John Locke, Voltaire, Thomas Jefferson, and Benjamin Franklin were proponents of Deism, advocating for the primacy of reason in matters of faith and promoting religious tolerance.

In contrast to Deism, Atheism, though less widespread, also experienced a degree of growth during the Enlightenment. The rise of scientific explanations for natural phenomena led some individuals to doubt religious teaching altogether. Atheists do not believe in any god, arguing for the absence of sufficient evidence to support the existence of a divine being.

Figures such as Denis Diderot, a key editor of the monumental Encyclopédie, the big encyclopedia written in France, disseminated Atheist ideas by promoting a worldview grounded purely in natural causes devoid of divine influence. While often met with criticism, the Enlightenment's overarching emphasis on challenging established authority allowed Atheism to develop as a legitimate intellectual stance. Several prominent Enlightenment thinkers directly challenged religion and questioned its social influence.

Voltaire was a sharp critic of the Catholic Church, denouncing what he perceived as its hypocrisy and injustice. While Deist rather than an Atheist, he used his writings to advocate for religious tolerance and to argue for the separation of faith from public and intellectual life. Baruch Spinoza presented a radical new perspective on God, where God was not a personal being or intervening in the world, but was instead identical to nature itself, with everything being part of one infinite reality.

This view challenged both Jewish and Christian doctrines, leading to Spinoza's excommunication from his Jewish community. Spinoza laid the groundwork for a more philosophical understanding of spirituality, rooted in reason rather than religious tradition. The Scottish philosopher David Hume also delivered a potent critique of religion, questioning the rational basis for belief in God.

He cast doubt on arguments attempting to prove God's existence through observation of the natural world and critiqued miracles as violations of natural laws lacking sufficient evidence. Hume's skepticism encouraged a more critical approach to religious claims, mirroring the skepticism employed in scientific inquiry and other fields of knowledge. The growing popularity of science and philosophy during the Enlightenment led to the establishment of academic schools and societies, often with royal patronage across Europe.

These institutions, such as the Royal Society in London and the Académie des Sciences in Paris, played a crucial role in fostering new discoveries, conducting research, testing inventions and theories, and hosting public discussions and debates. Beyond the formal settings of academies, Enlightenment ideas were actively debated and disseminated in coffeehouses and salons that proliferated across Europe. These social gatherings in coffee shops and teahouses provided spaces for people to converse, read, think, drink, and exchange new ideas.

By the mid-18th century, major European cities posted numerous establishments becoming vital hubs for intellectual discourse among writers and thinkers. Perhaps the most ambitious undertaking embodying the spirit of the Enlightenment was the creation of the Encyclopédie, or the Encyclopedia, conceived by French thinkers Denis Diderot and Jean-Laurent Lambert. Its fundamental goal was to transform the world by disseminating knowledge.

Published between 1751 and 1772, this monumental work comprised of over 72,000 articles. Diderot and Lambert placed humanity at the center of their endeavor, emphasizing human faculties among memory, reason, imagination as the means to understand life. In conclusion, we owe a profound debt to the Enlightenment for inspiring our reliance on logic, on reason, and rationalism, and to understand the natural world, and for establishing the fundamental principles of liberty, progress, and freedom that underpin modern democratic societies.

Now you are free to continue with today's lesson. Take care.

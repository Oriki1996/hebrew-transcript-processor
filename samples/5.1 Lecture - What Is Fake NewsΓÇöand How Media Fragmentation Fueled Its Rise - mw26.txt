Hi, on July 13, 2024, at a rally near Butler, Pennsylvania, a 20-year-old man named Thomas Matthew Crookes opened fire from a rooftop roughly 150 meters from where Donald Trump was delivering a campaign speech. Armed with an AR-15-style rifle, Crookes fired eight rounds. One bullet grazed Trump's upper right ear.

Tragically, a spectator was killed and two others were critically wounded before the Secret Service agents shot and killed the gunman at the scene. In the immediate aftermath, misinformation flooded social media. False claims circulated that the attack had been staged to boost sympathy for Trump, citing doctored images and misleading videos.

Others pushed baseless allegations that the shooter was tied to political organizations or a foreign government, despite law enforcement confirming he acted alone. Some even suggested the shooting was part of a deep state plot to eliminate Trump and ensure a Biden victory. These fake stories not only distorted public understanding of the event, but also highlighted the challenges of combating misinformation in real time during high-profile incidents.

The chaos that followed the July 13 attempt on Trump's life was not only on the ground, it exploded online. In mere hours, facts blurred with fiction and conspiracy outpaced clarity. But this is not a new phenomenon.

To understand how we got here, how the line between truth and narrative has always been fragile, we need to rewind. Long before viral tweets and deepfakes, newspapers were the battleground for political influence, and objectivity was more of an aspiration than a standard. So how did journalism evolve from partisan mouthpieces to institutions claiming neutrality and objectivity?

Let's go back to the origins of the American press. For many of us, the news seemed like a straightforward presentation of facts, ideally striving for objectivity. However, the journey of the media has been far from a straight line towards this ideal.

According to media historian Michael Schutzen, in the early days of newspapers, particularly in the 18th and early 19th centuries, newspapers were often close-tied to political parties. Just to give you a sense, in 1850 in the United States, the U.S. Census counted 16,030 party newspapers and only 83 independent papers. These early party papers served as a vehicle for partisan debate and propaganda, openly promoting the views of their affiliated political groups.

Think of them less as neutral information providers and more as outspoken advocates for a particular political agenda. A significant shift began in the 1830s with the rise of the penny press. These newspapers, costing just a penny, aimed to reach a much broader audience than their more expensive predecessors.

To attract this mass readership, penny papers often focused on more sensational and human interest stories. While this era didn't immediately usher in objectivity, the need to appeal to a diverse readership with varying political views may have suddenly begun to dilute the intensity of the partisan tone that some newspapers had. The late 19th and early 20th centuries witnessed another crucial transformation, the professionalization of journalism.

This period saw an emergence of objectivity as a guiding ideal within the profession. This ideal wasn't simply about neutrality. It involved a commitment to accuracy in the pursuit of variable facts.

Journalists began to emphasize the importance of reporting facts without personal bias, attributing information to sources and presenting multiple sides of the story. This quest for getting the story just right involved developing new routines and practices for news gathering and reporting. For instance, the idea of separating facts from opinion became more prevalent.

The development of professional norms and ethics within journalism schools and organizations further reinforced this emphasis on accuracy and truthfulness. The desire for greater credibility and public trust was also a significant driving force behind this shift. The rise of objectivity didn't emerge simply from ethical awakening.

It was also a strategic response to changing commercial and political realities. As newspapers aimed to appeal to a wider, less ideologically fixed audience, objectivity offered a way to position themselves as trustworthy, authoritative sources in a competitive and sometimes hostile information environment. This serious, fact-based approach to journalism would prove vital decades later during one of the most consequential investigations in American political history, the Watergate scandal.

The reporting that uncovered it exemplified the gold standard of careful sourcing, editorial oversight, and relentless verification. In a media landscape increasingly distorted by speed and speculation, Watergate remains a model of what journalism should aspire to be. When two young reporters at the Washington Post, Bob Woodward and Carl Burstyn, first started digging into the strange breaking at the Democratic National Committee headquarters in 1972, they had no idea they were about to unravel the most explosive political scandal in American history.

It began with five men caught red-handed at a Watergate complex, but Woodward and Burstyn soon uncovered threats that led deep into the heart of the President's Nixon administration. So what exactly was the Watergate scandal? At first, it looked like a bungled breaking, but the five men arrested were found to have connections to President Nixon's re-election campaign.

As more facts came into light, it became clear that this was not an isolated incident, but part of a much larger effort to spy on political opponents, sabotage rival campaigns, and manipulate the democratic process from within the highest levels of government. Even more shocking was the administration's attempt to cover it up using hush money and pressuring law enforcement agencies to halt the investigation. Eventually, the investigation, led by reporters, congressional committees, and a special prosecutor, revealed a pattern of abuse of power, lies, and the obstruction of justice.

Nixon's own secret recordings at the White House, which he had installed to document conversations, ultimately served as proof of his involvement. Faced with near-certain impeachment, Nixon resigned in August 1974, the first and only U.S. president to do so. The scandal changed how Americans viewed the presidency, and it cemented journalism's role as a democratic watchdog.

Their reporting was anything but easy. Every new detail they uncovered had to clear a gauntlet of checks by editors, by fact-checkers, and even legal counsel. The stakes were enormous.

They weren't just exposing corruption. They were accusing the most powerful people in the country of abuse of power and systemic cover-up. At a time when much of the mainstream press was hesitant to pursue the story, the Washington Post editors demanded near-obsessive accuracy.

Every source had to be confirmed, every sentence scrutinized. As you'll see in the following clip, executive editor Ben Bradley insisted on multiple verifications before anything could be printed. Even with the anonymous sources as explosive as Deep Throat, later revealed to be FBI Associate Director Mark Felt, their editors pushed back.

We need more than whispers in the parking garage, Bradley warned. The pressure was intense. Legal threats from the White House, political backlash, and constant doubts from both inside and outside the newsroom.

After making a mistake in one of their facts, Bradley called Woodward and Bernstein into his office and began shouting, You guys are about to write the story that says the former Attorney General, the highest-ranking law enforcement officer of this country, is a crook. Just be sure you're right. The moment underscores journalism's core.

Stories must be bulletproof. Rigor, verification, and restraint, not speed, gave Watergate reporting its strength. It wasn't one explosive scoop, but a steadily stream of confirmed facts that brought down the President.

Now, sit back and move on to the next segment to watch a clip from the movie All the President's Men, a movie that is based on Woodward's and Bernstein's investigation. Enjoy.

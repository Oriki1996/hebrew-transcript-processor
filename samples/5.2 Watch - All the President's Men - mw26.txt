[דובר 5] (0:14 - 0:15)
Let's open on this now. Come on, now.

[דובר 4] (0:15 - 0:30)
Mr. Bentley, here we go. Get the artwork. Right corner piece.

Okay, let's have it. Yeah, here you are, Ben. Good solid piece of American journalism.

Except the New York Times doesn't.

[דובר 1] (0:56 - 1:00)
You haven't got it. Librarian and secretary say Hunt looked at a book. That's not good enough.

[דובר 3] (1:00 - 1:08)
White House aide told me that Hunt was investigating Kennedy. Who was it? Who was it?

You want the name, you mean?

[דובר 1] (1:08 - 1:11)
No, no, how senior, how high up. I don't know titles.

[דובר 2] (1:26 - 1:29)
Show a special interest. You know, we said that the White House was investigating Kennedy.

[דובר 1] (1:30 - 1:31)
Show a special interest, then.

[דובר 2] (1:31 - 1:38)
Gee, this is a story stronger than that. We got a White House librarian who said that Hunt checked out a whole lot of books. We got a secretary in Colson's office who said Hunt was...

[דובר 1] (1:38 - 1:38)
All right, Carl.

[דובר 4] (1:39 - 1:41)
Ben, that's a page one story.

[דובר 1] (1:43 - 1:56)
Stick it inside someplace. This is a goddamn important story. Get some harder information next time.

[דובר 2] (2:02 - 2:11)
That's cold. Bradley, just sticking it for the Kennedys. We didn't have it, Bolsa.

Bullshit, we had it cold. No, we didn't. Why don't you say something?

You think bitching about it is going to get the story wherever you want it?

[דובר 1] (2:13 - 2:22)
Throw it in the Kennedy. Hey, what do you guys want? The GAO reports due out the morning of Nixon's renomination.

Hey, sit down, sit down.

[דובר 3] (2:23 - 2:30)
Unless two weeks from now. If it's just early responsible to Congress, there is no way the White House can control the investigation.

[דובר 2] (2:30 - 2:38)
There's a source over at General Accounting that tells us that there's a whole rat's nest of illegal shit going on over at CREEP. Like what? Like a slush fund.

[דובר 1] (2:38 - 3:54)
Hundreds of thousands of dollars of unaccounted for cash. Hundreds of thousands of dollars? Any comment from CREEP?

Yes, unavailable for comment. They're not talking. Well, what else besides the money?

Where's the goddamn story? The money's the key to whatever this is. Says who?

Deep Throat. Who? Oh, that's Woodward's garage freak.

His source and the executive. Garage freak? Jesus, what kind of a crazy fucking story is this?

What did you say? He's on deep background. I call him Deep Throat.

Look, McGovern's dropped to nothing. Nixon's guaranteed the re-nomination. The Post is stuck with the story no one else wants.

It'll sink the goddamn paper. Everyone says, get off it, Ben. And I come on very sage and I say, well, you'll see.

You wait till this bottoms out. But the truth is, I can't figure out what we've got. What else you working on?

We're after a list of CREEP employees. Where is it? It's classified.

Well, how are you gonna get it? We haven't had any luck yet. Get some.

Anything else? I don't know. Still feels thin.

Oh, Christ. I wish I knew if we could print this.

[דובר 4] (3:54 - 3:55)
Oh, wait a minute.

[דובר 3] (3:55 - 4:14)
You know, we didn't make them do these things, but once they did, they're fair game. Harry, let's go over your sources again. I want to hear it.

Sloan told the grand jury. He answered everything they asked him. That means there's got to be a record somewhere.

He told the grand jury the FBI confirms what more do you need? I happen to love this country. You know, we're not a bunch of zanies out to bring it down.

Harry, weren't you arguing the opposite way?

[דובר 4] (4:16 - 4:17)
Hold it.

[דובר 1] (4:18 - 4:40)
Hold it. We're about to accuse Haldeman, who only happens to be the second most important man in this country, of conducting a criminal conspiracy from inside the White House. It would be nice if we were right.

You double-checked your sources. I'm right. Bernstein, are you sure on this story?

Absolutely. Woodward? I'm sure.

I'm not. Still seems thin. Get another source.

[דובר 2] (4:40 - 4:42)
How many fucking sources do you think we've got?

[דובר 3] (4:47 - 4:54)
Are you sure Detroit won't confirm? He won't confirm. I told you that.

What about the guy in justice? You can't call. Why?

He's right next to the grand jury.

[דובר 2] (4:54 - 4:54)
We have no choice.

[דובר 3] (4:54 - 4:57)
Trouble. 20 minutes to deadline. Look, I don't even know if I can get him on the phone.

[דובר 5] (5:14 - 5:15)
Dr. Kissinger's office.

[דובר 3] (5:15 - 5:23)
Deputy General's office, please. Do you know when you expect him back?

[דובר 5] (5:23 - 5:28)
No, sir. I believe he's left for the evening. Sorry.

If you'd like to leave a message, could you hold, please?

[דובר 2] (5:29 - 5:38)
Hi, this is Carl. I'm sorry to disturb you now, but we're going with the story that Halden was the fifth man in control of the fund, and they're hassling us here. We've got three confirmations, but if you could just help us, I'd appreciate it.

[דובר 4] (5:38 - 5:40)
Look, I won't say anything about Halden, not ever.

[דובר 2] (5:41 - 5:47)
I understand that. We wouldn't want you to do that. We know it's against the law for you to say anything.

If there's some way you could warn us to hold on the story, we'd appreciate it.

[דובר 5] (5:47 - 5:48)
I'd really like to help you, but I can't.

[דובר 2] (5:50 - 6:22)
Look, I'm going to count to 10, all right? If there's any reason we should hold on the story, hang up the phone before I get to 10. If the story's all right, you'll just be on the phone after I get to 10, all right?

Hang up, right? That's right. You got it?

Yeah. We're straight. All right, I'm going to start counting.

Okay? We all right? Yeah.

Okay, I'm counting. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

[דובר 4] (6:24 - 6:27)
You got it straight, ma'am? Everything okay?

[דובר 2] (6:28 - 6:29)
Everything's fine.

[דובר 4] (6:33 - 6:34)
One more!

[דובר 3] (6:39 - 7:01)
He confirmed it. What happened? I said if I get to 10, and you don't hang up, it's solid.

Did he confirm it? Absolutely. Get it?

Yeah, Brad. Thank you. Bernstein got another source.

The guy just was confirmed.

[דובר 1] (7:03 - 7:12)
If there's any doubt, we can run it tomorrow. You don't have to. The story's solid.

We're sure of it. He's just got off the phone, and it's gold. Okay, we go with it.

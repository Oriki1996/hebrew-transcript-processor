Hello, from claims that the moon landing was faked, to QAnon, to vaccine microchips, conspiracies are just everywhere. But why are they so compelling? Well, grab your coffee and let's explore the psychology, the evolution, and the group dynamics behind conspiratorial thinking.

First things first, what even is a conspiracy theory? Psychologists define a conspiracy theory as the belief that a group of individuals or institutions are covertly working together to achieve a malevolent or a deceptive goal. This belief goes beyond mere skepticism or doubt.

It reflects a firm conviction that powerful actors are secretly manipulating events behind the scenes. Crucially, conspiracy theories always involve a group, whether it's a government agency, a pharmaceutical company, or an elite, not a solidary individual. This group is assumed to operate in deliberate secrecy, hidden from the public scrutiny, and typically with harmful intentions.

These could take the form of the Illuminati, the Deep State, pharmaceutical companies, the Jews, and many, many more. They are conspiracies for everyone. As you can see in this figure, many Americans believe in numerous conspiracies.

More than half of them still believe that there was a conspiracy to murder President Kennedy, that COVID vaccines were used to insert microchips into our bodies, and even some who still believe that the moon landing was faked. In Israel, too, many believe in many weird things. 6% believe that the Earth is flat, that humans have nothing to do with global warming, and 30% believe that pharmaceutical companies are hiding from us dangers of vaccines.

This begs the question, why do so many people believe in conspiracies? We can think of nine reasons or causes for this. Let's begin.

The first one is epistemic, our need to make sense of the world. We seek explanations for the events around us, especially when these events are threatening, unpredictable, or emotionally charged. Conspiracy theories make sense of complex and chaotic realities.

They offer a seductive kind of clarity, providing simple explanations where real world ones feel ambiguous or incomplete. When something major happens, a global pandemic or an assassination of a leader, we instinctively assume the cause must be equally significant. This is known as the proportionality bias, the tendency to believe that big events must have big causes.

This is the very reason why it is difficult for many to accept that on 9-11, 19 young Arabs, undetected by the FBI, could fly large airplanes into the Twin Towers, kill thousands of Americans, and bring a nation to its knees. Therefore, we seek an alternative explanation, one that must be an inside job, or blame the FBI, the Jews, or others just to make sense of it all. Research shows that people who feel a lack of control or certainty are significantly more likely to endorse conspiratorial thinking.

The less agency people feel in their own lives, the more they grasp for patterns, whether those patterns are real or imagined. They suit those who feel uncertainty by telling us not only what happened, but why it happened and who's to blame. The second reason is existential.

In times of crisis, war, pandemics, political instability, people are afraid and crave a sense of control. In such times, conspiracy theories become a psychological survival mechanism, a way to impose meaning on events that otherwise seem random or senseless. They offer a powerful illusion that behind event crisis, there is a deliberate plan and behind every hardship, a hidden hand.

Even if the truth is terrifying, that viruses mutate, that governments sometimes fail, that accidents happen, conspiracies propose a more manageable alternative. Someone is behind this. COVID-19 spread to allow Bill Gates to insert chips inside the COVID-19 vaccine to control us, or that the California fires are not due to global warming, but a plot orchestrated by the Jews and their Jewish lasers.

Moving along, conspiracy theories often serve a social function. They help us protect our group image and boost collective self-esteem. When our group is losing, struggling, or accused of wrongdoing, conspiracy narratives offer a convenient defense.

We're not to blame. The system is rigged against us. This reinforces group loyalty and provides a psychological buffer against shame, failure, or guilt.

For example, in part of the Middle East, polls have shown widespread belief that the US and Israel orchestrated 9-11. These beliefs aren't just about geopolitics. They reflect a deep need to resist narratives that paints one's group as weak, backward, or complicit.

Conspiracies, in this context, become tools of collective identity maintenance. They reframe victimhood as resistance and deflect blame onto an external enemy. A fourth reason suggests that belief in conspiracy theories may have evolved as an adaptive response to real dangers in our ancestral environments.

In small-scale societies, threats like tribal warfare, poisoned food sources, or betrayal by rivals were ever-present. Being overly trusting could be fatal. A healthy dose of suspicion could mean the difference between life and death.

From this perspective, conspiracy thinking operates like a cognitive smoke detector, a system designed to err on the side of caution. It's evolutionary safer to mistakenly believe there's a plot when there isn't one than to overlook a real threat. This till this day means that mental mechanisms can misfire, leading us to see conspiracies when none exist.

Conspiracy theories serve another function. They divide the world into us versus them. By portraying outgroups as dangerous, corrupt, or evil, conspiracies help mobilize in-group around a shared sense of threat and righteousness.

They affirm, we are the victims, they are the manipulators. This division led many right-wing Israelis to baselessly claim that left-wing elements within the Shin Bet, particularly its chief Ronen Barr, had prior knowledge of the Hamas attack on October 7th, but deliberately chose not to act, hoping that a military defeat would force Netanyahu and his right-wing government to resign. This phenomenon is far from unique.

In countries like Hungary and Argentina, conspiracy theories about George Soros manipulating politics fuel populist narratives, intensify polarization, and strengthen group identity. They often serve to justify hostility, foster distrust, and encourage withdrawal from the mainstream society. What begins as a suspicion can escalate into exclusion, discrimination, or even violence.

A sixth explanation rests in people themselves. Some individuals are more predisposed to conspiracy thinking based on their personality traits and cognitive tendencies. Some people are driven by a need for uniqueness, a desire to stand out from the crowd and feel intellectually or morally superior.

Conspiracy theories cater to this need by offering a secret knowledge that the mainstream supposedly misses. Others, however, exhibit what psychologists call dark personality traits. These include manipulativeness known as Machiavellism, grandiosity and the sense of entitlement, which define narcissism, and an exaggerated suspicion of others, a characteristic of paranoia.

People who score high on these traits are more likely to believe in conspiracies, in part because they tend to assume others are lying, scheming, or acting in bad faith, perhaps because they themselves are more comfortable with deception or see it as a normal part of life. Another trait that may foster a conspiratorial mindset rests in someone's cognitive style. People who rely primarily on intuitive thinking, gut feeling, hunches, and immediate impressions are more prone to conspiracy beliefs.

In contrast, those who engage in more deliberative, analytical reasoning are generally more skeptical of such claims. It's not that the intuitive thinkers are less intelligent, but they tend to prioritize possibility over evidence. Let's turn now to the media.

While not a psychological need in the traditional sense, the media ecosystem plays a critical role in the spread and appeal of conspiracy theories. As we already learned a few weeks ago, social media platforms are designed to maximize engagement, and they do so by rewarding content that is sensational, emotionally charged, and often polarizing. Algorithms prioritize posts that confirm what users already believe, pushing them further down ideological rabbit holes.

Over time, this creates echo chambers, closed loops where conspiracy theories are repeated, validated, and rarely challenged. Within these digital silos, users become increasingly isolated from accurate or corrective information, making it even harder to distinguish fact from fiction. In this environment, conspiracy thinking isn't just tolerated, it thrives.

Our eighth reason has to do with elites. Elites, especially those in power, may deliberately promote conspiracy theories to serve their own agendas. By undermining trust in institutions, they shift attention away from their own failures.

When figures like Donald Trump or Benjamin Netanyahu blame the so-called deep state for economic or security crisis, they not just deflect responsibility, they are constructing a narrative that frames this crisis as the result of a hidden plot. This tactic allows them to avoid accountability while simultaneously rallying their base by casting another group or party as the enemy. Unlike most conspiracy theories, which tend to emerge from the bottom up, this approach, known as strategic conspiratism, is the top-down strategy.

It's about weaponizing public sentiment against a perceived threat, real or imagined, in order to maintain power. Finally, let us talk about the cultural context. In societies with low institutional trust, often those emerging from authoritarian rule or marked by a legacy of government secrecy, conspiracies tend to thrive.

Cultural values shape how these narratives unfold. Individualist cultures often focus on threats to personal freedom, while collectivist cultures emphasize harm to the group or community. And in places where religious or spiritual worldviews dominate, conspiracy thinking often mirrors those familiar struggles between good and evil.

So to sum up, why do people believe in conspiracy theories? As we've seen, the answer is complex. It's not just about gullibility or ignorance.

Conspiracy thinking taps into deep psychological needs for understanding, control, identity and belonging. It draws on our evolutionary instincts, thrives in a polarized media environment, and is sometimes deliberately stoked by those in power. And importantly, it's shaped by the cultural and political context people live in.

These theories offer seductive answers in a chaotic world. But they also come with real dangers, undermining trust, fueling division, and in some cases, inciting violence. Understanding why people believe in the first step of figuring out how to respond, not by mocking or dismissing, but by recognizing the fears, frustrations, and social dynamics that drive these beliefs.

And by building the kind of institutions, conversations, and communities that can earn back trust. I'll see you later.

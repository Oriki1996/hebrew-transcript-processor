They don't know how to deal with you.

[דובר 43] (0:39 - 0:46)
When your only course is to destroy your enemies, before they wake in the morning, have the ax in your hand.

[דובר 4] (1:10 - 1:27)
In a time of disinformation, and lies, the alliance between the conspiracy theorist, Alex Jones appeals to the worst parts of society, and he exploits them for his own benefit.

[דובר 44] (1:27 - 1:30)
the dirty trickster, He knows for Trump confidant Roger Stone.

[דובר 1] (1:30 - 1:32)
and the president. This election was stolen.

[דובר 3] (1:32 - 1:39)
A large group of Americans took to the streets in support of a conspiracy theory. It's poisoned our politics.

[דובר 7] (1:39 - 1:40)
Our democracy is suffering.

[דובר 1] (1:41 - 1:44)
Now on Frontline, United States of Conspiracy.

[דובר 21] (2:04 - 2:09)
This program contains mature content. Viewer discretion is advised.

[דובר 2] (2:12 - 2:21)
Ladies and gentlemen, it is 10.39 Central Standard Time, 11.39 Eastern. I'm Roger Stone. I worked in four administrations, been involved in nine campaigns.

[דובר 11] (2:21 - 2:33)
He's here tonight. It's a moment of enormous tension. I'm working the phones very aggressively, working my contacts.

But I'm going to shake your hand on a strong showing regardless.

[דובר 5] (2:33 - 2:50)
I was in the studio with Alex Jones and Roger on Election Day. And the metrics were off the charts about how many people were tuning in to InfoWars, numbers that were comparable to the networks.

[דובר 1] (2:51 - 2:58)
Alex Jones, extremist conspiracy theorist, had rallied his audience behind Donald Trump.

[דובר 11] (2:58 - 3:08)
He's saying Trump is projected to win. As the night grew on, it became clearer and clearer that Trump was likely to win.

[דובר 35] (3:09 - 3:12)
It is officially over. Pennsylvania has been called out.

[דובר 5] (3:12 - 3:16)
They had no idea whatsoever that Trump was going to win.

[דובר 10] (3:17 - 3:32)
All of a sudden, everybody was super elated. We had some staff members that was just running around the office in a big circle. I mean, people like, ah!

I mean, going crazy that night.

[דובר 33] (3:32 - 3:37)
You see him right there? He's going to be speaking momentarily. Love you guys.

[דובר 5] (3:37 - 3:53)
Love all of you. There was a combination of elation and confusion. And they realized that, oh, my God, we just played a role in making the president of the United States.

Here goes Trump.

[דובר 33] (3:54 - 3:55)
Turn it up.

[דובר 2] (3:55 - 3:56)
Donald J. Trump.

[דובר 33] (3:56 - 4:03)
He's going up to the microphones. He's going to be... The golden toad.

I assume he'll mention the phone call he received. Get ready.

[דובר 2] (4:03 - 4:18)
He charges into a goblin's nest. This is amazing. As long as he doesn't...

As long as he doesn't kiss a goblin, the goblin's fine. Catch him in bed with a goblin. I don't think there's any danger of that.

No, he defeated the goblin. He did it.

[דובר 3] (4:20 - 4:33)
Stone and Jones believed that they had been instrumental in getting Donald Trump elected. Or that certainly they had driven successful narratives that helped to get him elected.

[דובר 11] (4:33 - 4:43)
I was exhausted, but euphoric. Jones was exhausted, but he was downcast.

[דובר 2] (4:45 - 4:52)
It's almost 3 o'clock in the morning, central time. And we now have president-elect Donald Trump.

[דובר 11] (4:53 - 4:59)
And I asked him why. And he said, you don't understand. This is just the beginning.

[דובר 2] (5:00 - 5:16)
We are bound forever. And if we don't deliver this plan and free humanity, we will be bound in the ninth circle of hell. I'm bound to this truth, and I will never stop delivering.

[דובר 8] (5:16 - 5:25)
In that moment, it was visible that there was a reaction because he started crying. I mean, his emotions were evident. They were streaming down his face.

[דובר 2] (5:27 - 5:38)
I've said it. I've already run my course. I already know my entire life purpose has been completed.

I will continue on. But now, I realize I've won.

[דובר 3] (5:40 - 5:56)
Alex Jones is part of a bigger phenomenon. What people like Alex Jones and others showed us is that conspiracy theories are an effective political tool. They work.

They help shape elections. They help shape public discussion. They help people decide what to believe.

Conspiracy theories work.

[דובר 6] (5:57 - 6:03)
All across the country, you will see a lot of conspiracy theories out there.

[דובר 1] (6:03 - 6:07)
Alex Jones helped usher in a new and dangerous era in American politics.

[דובר 16] (6:08 - 6:11)
American conspiracy theories are entering a dangerous new phase.

[דובר 1] (6:12 - 6:26)
One where the truth doesn't matter. Where political opponents treat each other as mortal enemies. Where lies and conspiracies flourish.

[דובר 2] (6:28 - 6:30)
It's got inside jobs.

[דובר 1] (6:30 - 7:03)
The United States of Conspiracy. The story of how Alex Jones helped bring conspiracies into the mainstream began on the fringes of America in the 1990s. He was a late-night access TV personality in Austin, Texas.

An obscure voice peddling outrage.

[דובר 36] (7:04 - 7:08)
They are trying to make you dysfunctional. They are teaching you false thought systems.

[דובר 39] (7:08 - 7:11)
He began as sort of an underground phenomenon.

[דובר 36] (7:12 - 7:16)
Society is insane to me, so I'm insane to your average gumbo.

[דובר 39] (7:17 - 7:23)
You know, people in Austin would sit home and get high in the middle of the night and watch this crazy guy vent about crazy stuff.

[דובר 36] (7:24 - 7:26)
Hillary Clinton is a fascist worker.

[דובר 1] (7:26 - 7:28)
Unhinged conspiracy theory rants.

[דובר 36] (7:29 - 7:32)
Biological attacks. Imminent. Imminent.

[דובר 1] (7:33 - 7:33)
Political stunts.

[דובר 20] (7:34 - 7:39)
They took me into custody and were going to arrest me for disturbing a public meeting.

[דובר 9] (7:39 - 7:54)
He was on the fringe. It used to be that you would have to be somebody who was deep, deep into conspiracy culture to know who Alex Jones was. You'd have to know things about lizard people or teleportation paths.

These crazy, crazy conspiracy theories.

[דובר 21] (7:55 - 7:57)
What about me because I'm a woman? I've got to stay?

[דובר 1] (7:57 - 8:04)
British filmmaker John Ronson is a renowned expert on extremism. He has been following Jones for more than 20 years.

[דובר 12] (8:06 - 8:29)
He was diagnosed as having narcissistic personality disorder. And I think that's a factor because I think that people with NPD don't need to care as much about the truth and about society as other people do. I think they consider themselves more important than the truth.

[דובר 1] (8:42 - 8:58)
Jones promoted anti-government conspiracy theories in a series of homemade films. He'd also use a growing radio show to allege, without evidence, secret plots in crisis after crisis.

[דובר 2] (8:58 - 9:03)
The federal government financed and controlled this attack on the World Trade Center.

[דובר 1] (9:03 - 9:06)
The 1993 World Trade Center bombing.

[דובר 20] (9:07 - 9:11)
Multiple bombs ripped through the Albuquerque-Murrah Federal Building.

[דובר 1] (9:12 - 9:14)
The 1995 Oklahoma City bombing.

[דובר 20] (9:15 - 9:19)
And as usual, federal fingerprints were all over this tragic event.

[דובר 1] (9:19 - 9:21)
He called them false flags.

[דובר 3] (9:22 - 9:42)
A big element of Alex Jones' show and his theorizing generally is that things are false flag attacks. That is, attacks perpetrated by the government or elements within the government to create fear, suspicion, division, or to bring us all under the sinister control of the New World Order or the One World Government.

[דובר 20] (9:42 - 9:46)
To create yet another crisis, this time to usher in a police state...

[דובר 1] (9:46 - 9:50)
Jones' rhetoric resonated with people around the country who were looking for answers.

[דובר 6] (9:52 - 10:11)
Conspiracy theory is a theory. It's an attempt to explain an event. And it says that things are not as they seem.

And you explain it by picking up the dots, forming a pattern, and showing that that pattern indicates malignant intent by powerful people acting covertly.

[דובר 1] (10:12 - 10:16)
Then, a moment of trauma on live television.

[דובר 29] (10:16 - 10:35)
As a confused country watched. We want to go live right now and show you a picture of the World Trade Center where I understand... Do we have it?

No, we do not. We have a breaking story, though. We're going to come back with that in just a moment.

[דובר 1] (10:35 - 10:41)
That day, broadcasting from Texas, Jones would seize on the tragedy.

[דובר 15] (10:52 - 10:56)
Alex was immediately on the radio on all of his syndicated shows.

[דובר 18] (10:56 - 11:05)
To bring you up to speed on what's happened. At 8.50 a.m. EDT, plane hits World Trade Center. 9.30, Eastern second jet crashes at the World Trade Center.

[דובר 15] (11:06 - 11:17)
Saying that this attack is an inside job. Yes, the towers fell, but they were not felled by terrorists. They were destroyed by the United States government as a pretext to impose martial law.

[דובר 1] (11:18 - 11:22)
Jones and other believers became known as the 9-11 Truth Removement.

[דובר 12] (11:23 - 11:37)
Alex became the world's leading 9-11 truther. And actually, everything just got worse and darker. 9-11 conspiracy theorists were vicious and brutal.

[דובר 18] (11:38 - 11:48)
They're either using provocateur Arabs and allowing them to do it, or this is full complicity with the federal government. The evidence is overwhelming to bring you up to speed on what's happened.

[דובר 1] (11:49 - 11:56)
Even for the radio stations that had hosted Jones over the years, he'd gone too far this time.

[דובר 4] (11:57 - 12:14)
What you see after 9-11 is a country that is really, really hurting. People were grieving. There was a moment where people wouldn't have imagined that you're going to take that moment, this national moment of mourning, and turn it into a conspiracy theory.

[דובר 18] (12:16 - 12:18)
I'll tell you the bottom line.

[דובר 15] (12:26 - 12:36)
Overnight, something like two-thirds of all the Genesis stations dumped him. And it seemed like it was going to be a disaster for his career, and at first it was.

[דובר 1] (12:37 - 12:55)
But it was 2001, and Alex Jones quickly found a new outlet, a new way to reach a like-minded audience. The anarchy of the web. But the 9-11 truther movement was alive and well.

[דובר 9] (12:56 - 13:03)
It was the manipulation of that national tragedy that really, really opened an eye for Jones about how he could get a hook into his audience.

[דובר 1] (13:05 - 13:11)
His website, Infowars.com, became a hub for conspiracy theories.

[דובר 14] (13:12 - 13:32)
We all know a conspiracy theorist from the days before Twitter or Facebook. And those people were sort of isolated and shunned, and everybody felt like they had their number. But with social media and the Internet, they find each other.

And they can push that message to millions of people.

[דובר 13] (13:34 - 13:54)
The interesting thing about the Internet is that it builds community. You can find people who feed into your negativity, or your fears, or your bigotry. And so that's what Alex Jones has been able to do.

I mean, he's been able to mobilize people based on their fears. For many, their ignorance.

[דובר 1] (13:55 - 14:05)
As the tech giants grew, Facebook, Twitter, Spotify, Instagram, Google's YouTube, so did Alex Jones.

[דובר 38] (14:07 - 14:13)
Information that you would have been very hard to get before, it suddenly became easy.

[דובר 20] (14:14 - 14:15)
We're on the right side of history.

[דובר 38] (14:15 - 14:21)
He wasn't really my cup of tea, it was young men who liked him. Because he was wild, and he was funny.

[דובר 1] (14:23 - 14:56)
His audience was mostly white men. It became known as Dude Radio. Every week, millions watched his programs.

And his conspiracy movies. It was the type of controversial content that generated clicks. The more outrageous, the better.

The bigger the lie, the more clicks he got. And YouTube's algorithms recommended his videos billions of times.

[דובר 2] (14:56 - 15:01)
In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.

[דובר 10] (15:01 - 15:06)
His films got out to millions and millions and millions of people.

[דובר 2] (15:06 - 15:09)
The dawn of a new dark age is upon mankind.

[דובר 10] (15:10 - 15:24)
When we put out a film, I remember Endgame, within like, something like six or seven days, receiving like 30 million views. It was ridiculous. I just remember constantly refreshing, and it going up by thousands every time I'd refresh.

[דובר 1] (15:32 - 15:40)
Spreading wild conspiracy theories had made Jones a celebrity. But one question would not go away.

[דובר 15] (15:41 - 16:02)
How much of what Alex says on the radio does he really believe? And is Alex really crazy? If he's not crazy, and he says crazy things on the radio and on TV and on YouTube every day, in order to exploit other people who are crazy to make money for himself, then that doesn't look good at all.

[דובר 2] (16:02 - 16:05)
Announce DNA force, ladies and gentlemen.

[דובר 1] (16:05 - 16:10)
But it didn't matter to Jones or his audience. He had found a winning formula.

[דובר 6] (16:11 - 16:18)
He is the exemplar of a conspiracy entrepreneur. There's a whole new industry that's grown up.

[דובר 2] (16:19 - 16:21)
That's my second dose today. I need to take it easy.

[דובר 6] (16:22 - 16:28)
He sells, you know, potency pills. He's into virility, and he sells body armor and gold and other things.

[דובר 1] (16:29 - 16:36)
At Infowars.com, they sold gold, pills, and fear.

[דובר 3] (16:36 - 16:51)
He was smart because he correctly realized that he had to sell a product. Especially a survivalist product that people thought they would need under the coming, you know, nightmarish new world government was very prescient.

[דובר 12] (16:53 - 17:00)
Alex overnight made a huge amount of money. I mean, somebody told me that he was bringing in like $100,000 a day.

[דובר 1] (17:02 - 17:06)
It was rock star money. He decided to live like one.

[דובר 21] (17:07 - 17:21)
We went from the little house to the slightly bigger house to a really nice house to multiple houses. And you get all this money, and Alex always wanted more and more and more. And I was like, Alex, what are you doing?

We don't even do these things.

[דובר 15] (17:22 - 17:32)
Somewhere along the line, he started making an awful lot of money. And so once that started happening, even if he had stopped becoming a believer, there was a very powerful incentive to continue doing what he was doing.

[דובר 2] (17:33 - 17:40)
I will go to hell before I sit here and I watch this country and the world turned over to these savages.

[דובר 1] (17:40 - 17:43)
Jones' audience was insatiable, and he delivered.

[דובר 2] (17:44 - 17:47)
Let me tell you something, you filthy traitors in the government, you pieces of crap.

[דובר 1] (17:48 - 17:52)
More conspiracy, more controversy, more crisis.

[דובר 2] (17:53 - 17:56)
I've had enough of these people. I've been containing this for the last week.

[דובר 5] (17:56 - 18:23)
That's why I've been in here sweating. If you are always on the radio, if you are always on television, you always have to top yourself. You have to create a more wild, more extreme conspiracy theory to keep your audience engaged.

You can't just keep coming out with the same line every single day. And so you force, you are compelled to push yourself to ever greater extremes.

[דובר 27] (18:23 - 18:31)
I think there's somebody shooting in here.

[דובר 1] (18:31 - 18:35)
For Alex Jones, there seemed to be no boundary to his increasingly extreme theories.

[דובר 27] (18:35 - 18:37)
They're still shooting.

[דובר 1] (18:38 - 18:41)
No tragedy too awful to exploit.

[דובר 2] (18:44 - 19:05)
Ladies and gentlemen, it is Friday. Thank you so much for joining us the 14th day of December 2012. And there is a reported school shooting in Connecticut.

This is going to be a lot bigger than Columbine. And this is already 18 dead children.

[דובר 1] (19:06 - 19:15)
In the end, 27 killed. 20 of them elementary school children. Jones seized on the deaths.

[דובר 2] (19:15 - 19:25)
Boy, wouldn't you know, I mean, it's sick. You can go back in the last month, and I've said over and over again, and you watch, there's going to be giant school shootings.

[דובר 10] (19:26 - 19:37)
The moment you see a mass shooting event, the mindset inside is, it's probably a false flag operation. It might not be, but it probably is.

[דובר 2] (19:38 - 19:51)
If we start seeing telltale signs of it being staged, we'll let you know. You know, it has now come out that it was a government program, and that person was in a mind control program.

[דובר 6] (19:52 - 20:05)
And this is conspiracy without the theory. The dispenses with, blatantly dispenses with any evidence or argument. It lives by sheer assertion, no evidence, no argument.

[דובר 2] (20:06 - 20:14)
And the doctor he was under was a head Air Force mind control doctor, and he was involved in DARPA brain interface programs, until he was under mind control in the jail.

[דובר 9] (20:15 - 20:37)
He just kept adding more and more and more outrageous lies to the story. All the pictures of the children inside of it were fake. It was all a CGI construction.

For Jones, it didn't matter how absurd each new layer got. He would put anything on the air, as long as it kept driving the Sandy Hook story. Newtown destroyed suspected Sandy Hook shooter's home.

[דובר 1] (20:38 - 20:43)
Even inside Infowars, some of Jones' own staff worried about what he was saying.

[דובר 8] (20:43 - 21:00)
But the media still lies and says he did. Jones had no evidence whatsoever to prove that that didn't happen. And he said it many times, because that's just what fit into his world view.

That's what, I mean, on some level, it felt like that's what he wanted it to be.

[דובר 1] (21:01 - 21:08)
One of Jones' employees, longtime editor Rob Jacobson, brought his concerns directly to Jones.

[דובר 10] (21:08 - 21:23)
I stopped him and I was like, Alex, man, they're going to come after you for Sandy Hook. I was like, look, man, this is crazy. And he just stopped and looked at me with no reaction.

He had nothing to say to me. He just stopped like a deer in headlights.

[דובר 1] (21:25 - 21:26)
And he wasn't alone.

[דובר 9] (21:27 - 21:40)
I think it's important to note the top editorial person inside of Infowars desperately warned him and tried to get employees to help warn Alex Jones that what he was doing was very, very bad. He didn't listen.

[דובר 41] (21:41 - 21:49)
I've looked at it, and undoubtedly, there's a cover up, there's actors, they're manipulating, they've been caught lying, and they were pre-planning before it rolled out.

[דובר 1] (21:49 - 21:53)
Jones spared no one. He even went after the families.

[דובר 4] (21:56 - 22:21)
And Alex Jones looks at those tiny caskets and these grieving parents and decides that he's going to make their lives a living hell by selling this conspiracy theory that Newtown is all a fraud and that all of these people are actors.

[דובר 1] (22:32 - 22:39)
Six-year-old Noah Posner was killed by the Sandy Hook shooter, but his family became a victim of Alex Jones.

[דובר 16] (22:40 - 22:51)
My wife at the time, Noah's mother, did a few interviews, and she became a target. He accused her of being an actor.

[דובר 4] (22:52 - 22:54)
I'm grieving, that's all.

[דובר 16] (22:54 - 23:00)
That became one of the cornerstone conspiracy points for Sandy Hook.

[דובר 2] (23:01 - 23:14)
The whole thing was fake. I mean, even I couldn't believe it. I knew they jumped on it, used the crisis, piped it up, but then I did deep research, and my gosh, it just pretty much didn't happen.

[דובר 1] (23:14 - 23:16)
As Jones added fuel to the fire...

[דובר 2] (23:16 - 23:19)
We've sent reporters up there, man, and that place is like Children of the Corn or something.

[דובר 1] (23:19 - 23:23)
Online conspiracy theorists were attacking the families.

[דובר 9] (23:23 - 23:28)
From then on, it was an absolute quest to destroy these parents.

[דובר 31] (23:28 - 23:33)
What a loser. Crisis actor trash. Oh, Lenny, you poser.

Take your life.

[דובר 1] (23:34 - 23:37)
It spread on the Web, YouTube, Reddit, and 4chan.

[דובר 31] (23:37 - 23:41)
What kind of name is Noah Posner? They're haters.

[דובר 16] (23:42 - 23:49)
They're fools. They're trolls. Anything they can do to trigger trouble in my life, they have done.

[דובר 1] (23:51 - 23:57)
Posner changed addresses many times, tried to hide his identity. Still, they found him.

[דובר 16] (23:57 - 24:06)
I got a call from someone, and I had just moved into a new apartment. He read me the address that I had just moved into, and he read me my Social Security number.

[דובר 9] (24:07 - 24:13)
A woman began stalking Mr. Posner and his family in South Central Florida. Started threatening their lives.

[דובר 32] (24:14 - 24:15)
You're going to die.

[דובר 1] (24:19 - 24:22)
She was an avid follower of Jones and Infowars.

[דובר 9] (24:23 - 24:33)
And she was soon sent to federal prison for what she was doing. Mr. Jones knew this. He understood this.

He absolutely knew what was happening. He wanted Lenny Posner to suffer harm.

[דובר 1] (24:34 - 24:36)
Posner was forced to live in hiding.

[דובר 8] (24:37 - 24:58)
Whatever is happening to these families clearly didn't mean anything to him. It's obvious that Jones isn't remorseful or apologetic for any of the things that those families had to endure from the words that he dispelled or the ideas that he spread. I genuinely don't think he cares.

[דובר 1] (25:00 - 25:06)
People close to Jones were appalled about what he had done. It was the last straw for his wife Kelly.

[דובר 21] (25:07 - 25:18)
I was very disgusted by what he said. I think I definitely told him, like, what are you doing? Why are you doing this?

And they were just so excited that they were getting so many views or whatever and they continued to do this.

[דובר 1] (25:19 - 25:25)
They filed for divorce in 2013 and have been in a bitter, sometimes public feud for years.

[דובר 18] (25:31 - 25:37)
The king of conspiracy, radio show host Alex Jones. Alex Jones, the king of all Internet conspiracies.

[דובר 1] (25:38 - 25:42)
The controversy over Sandy Hook had made Jones bigger than ever.

[דובר 27] (25:42 - 25:44)
Alex Jones is pushing a lot of buttons.

[דובר 1] (25:44 - 26:11)
He was now tapping into not just the conspiracy world, but the country's culture wars and growing populist anger. In hard right politics, he was becoming a player. And in the country's first black president, Jones had another target.

[דובר 2] (26:11 - 26:15)
First black president from Kenya, born in Kenya. Boom!

[דובר 1] (26:16 - 26:21)
Jones pushed the discredited birther theory, questioning President Obama's citizenship.

[דובר 4] (26:22 - 26:28)
In birtherism, what you see is a group of Americans who resent the fact that there is an African American president in the White House.

[דובר 20] (26:28 - 26:32)
Boom! We're told there is no long form. It doesn't exist.

Oh, yeah, here it is.

[דובר 4] (26:32 - 26:57)
It's fake. Alex Jones and all sorts of other people, they hand them this excuse that is, well, he wasn't born in this country and this is really all a lie and that he is actually not who he says he is. This is how they try to start the revolution.

Alex Jones appeals to the worst parts of society and he looks for all the terrible things in society. Racism, sexism, misogyny, and he exploits them for his own benefit.

[דובר 2] (26:58 - 27:02)
This is what they're trying to get going. This is a race war. This is exactly what we predicted.

[דובר 1] (27:02 - 27:12)
Jones unabashedly exploited race, stoking fear of nothing but white people's cars being stopped by mobs of black people, sounding alarms.

[דובר 2] (27:12 - 27:18)
Record numbers of Muslims are being brought in from countries known to be radicalized and who want to attack...

[דובר 13] (27:18 - 27:33)
Alex Jones is able to tap into some real deep, dark fears that white Americans explicitly have about the future of their country, who's in it, who's controlling it, and their placement in it.

[דובר 1] (27:34 - 27:41)
He was promoting a politics of conspiracy and lies that would find its moment in 2015.

[דובר 31] (27:42 - 27:48)
Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God. It's Alex Jones.

[דובר 1] (27:49 - 27:52)
When he invited a special guest on his program.

[דובר 2] (27:52 - 27:58)
He's written the New York Times best-selling book, The Men Who Killed Kennedy. You've probably heard of rogerstone.com. Good to see you again, buddy.

[דובר 10] (27:58 - 28:08)
Alex, great to see you. Thanks for having me. Nobody had any idea at that point that this is somebody that would be coming back again and again and again.

[דובר 40] (28:08 - 28:18)
Well, Alex, first of all, I want to thank you because nobody has been more effective in terms of revealing the secret game plan of the party kingmakers.

[דובר 1] (28:18 - 28:21)
Roger Stone was a notorious political operator.

[דובר 19] (28:22 - 28:27)
Roger Stone is a self-described dirty trickster.

[דובר 1] (28:28 - 28:30)
A career dating back to Richard Nixon.

[דובר 19] (28:30 - 28:32)
There's a tattoo of Nixon on his back.

[דובר 5] (28:34 - 28:53)
Roger is singular in the political landscape. He is a body-building, pot-smoking, dandy swinger who has had a profound impact upon shaping all of our lives through his savvy and cunning as a political consultant.

[דובר 2] (28:54 - 29:01)
He was the chairman of Donald Trump's exploratory campaign. We talked to Trump this morning. He was telling me off-air, Trump's for real.

[דובר 1] (29:02 - 29:08)
In 2015, Stone had an insight that Alex Jones' audience could help Donald Trump.

[דובר 11] (29:09 - 29:30)
You can't buy Trump. You can't bully Trump. Alex Jones is a character, and he has a very, very large, very, very loyal following out there in the blogosphere.

His people are very dedicated.

[דובר 2] (29:31 - 29:32)
They're very loyal.

[דובר 8] (29:36 - 29:52)
Stone was getting a big platform out of Jones. Where do you want to start, Mr. Stone? Stone could come on Jones' show and talk to what would ultimately be millions of people.

I think that Jones was getting some type of validation from Stone.

[דובר 35] (29:52 - 30:03)
They can call us conspiracy theorists. As you know, that's a way to try to discredit us. All we are is truth-tellers.

We speak from the heart, like Donald Trump. We speak from the heart and let the chips fall where they may.

[דובר 1] (30:08 - 30:18)
As the first Republican primaries approached, Donald Trump was a long shot. Stone wanted him to make an important connection.

[דובר 2] (30:19 - 30:32)
Well, I don't usually get butterflies about a guest on the show. Donald Trump is our guest, ladies and gentlemen, for the next 30 minutes or so. He is the leading 2016 Republican presidential contender, Donald Trump.

[דובר 11] (30:33 - 30:42)
It was a signal to Jones' literally millions of followers that Trump was the man to support in the Republican primary.

[דובר 2] (30:42 - 30:49)
And I've got so many questions, but first off, Donald, thank you for joining us. Thank you, Alex. Great.

Great to be with you.

[דובר 37] (30:49 - 31:02)
Trump recognized the power of Alex Jones' audience and Alex Jones' base and had mirrored a lot of Alex Jones' policies and rhetoric in achieving and getting to that front-runner status in the first place.

[דובר 24] (31:02 - 31:17)
I know now from top people that you actually are for real. Alex was only too happy to play sycophants. He is epic.

It's George Washington level. And you understand that... And Trump basked in the glow of his adulation.

[דובר 5] (31:18 - 31:24)
And so I think it was purely transactional and it worked out great for both of them.

[דובר 17] (31:24 - 31:32)
I just want to finish by saying your reputation's amazing. I will not let you down. You will be very, very impressed, I hope.

[דובר 6] (31:32 - 31:44)
He said, I have so much admiration for you. You have such an audience. I mean, this is what Trump cared about.

You have such influence. We're going to be talking a lot. I'm going to be relying on you.

[דובר 2] (31:44 - 31:51)
I hope you can help uncripple America. Thank you so much, sir. You will be attacked for coming on and we know you know that.

Thank you. Thank you very much.

[דובר 4] (31:52 - 32:07)
Alex Jones, like President Trump, they come from this friend. They come from a place that people maybe poked fun of them. They come from this place where people maybe didn't take them seriously, but they saw their way to the center of American politics.

[דובר 5] (32:09 - 32:27)
Roger delivers legitimacy to Alex Jones and Alex Jones delivers to Trump a disaffected voter that Trump desperately needed to bring to the polls in order to win. And that was, I think, in a lot of ways, the difference maker.

[דובר 1] (32:28 - 32:31)
Jones boasted about his impact on the candidate.

[דובר 2] (32:32 - 32:39)
And I'll tell you, it is surreal to talk about issues here on air and then word for word hear Trump say it two days later.

[דובר 10] (32:39 - 32:47)
I mean, sometimes it was like verbatim, like, really, Trump? Really? You're taking his word for it?

You don't have anybody else around you?

[דובר 2] (32:47 - 32:51)
As we've been saying for three years, Hillary is the founder of ISIS, along with Obama.

[דובר 17] (32:53 - 33:01)
He founded ISIS. And I would say the co-founder would be crooked Hillary Clinton.

[דובר 2] (33:01 - 33:08)
Buzz Cruz's father linked the JFK assassination. Cuban hired by Lee Harvey Oswald bears striking resemblance to Cruz.

[דובר 18] (33:08 - 33:16)
You know, his father was with Lee Harvey Oswald prior to Oswald being, you know, shot. I mean, the whole thing is ridiculous.

[דובר 10] (33:16 - 33:21)
And I think it was a superpower trip for Alex that was irresistible.

[דובר 2] (33:22 - 33:24)
He's going to use executive orders to go after our guns.

[דובר 17] (33:24 - 33:29)
The president's thinking about signing an executive order where he wants to take your guns away.

[דובר 8] (33:29 - 33:39)
Someone in the mainstream, Trump, using the words that Jones had been using for decades, I think that emboldened Jones, and it changed him as a personality.

[דובר 2] (33:39 - 33:46)
These people are not fricking humans, OK? Hillary Clinton is a demon damned to hell.

[דובר 17] (33:46 - 33:50)
He made a deal with the devil. She's the devil. He made a deal with the devil.

[דובר 12] (33:51 - 34:15)
Big shock was Alex having the ear of a president to be. That was the biggest shock. Of all the people I've interviewed over 35 years, I can think of a lot of people I would rather have the presidency ear than Alex Jones.

It's a bit of a shame that one of the most spiraling people I've ever met is the one who's influencing Trump.

[דובר 20] (34:17 - 34:21)
The National Convention kicks off in Cleveland, Ohio tomorrow.

[דובר 33] (34:21 - 34:25)
It's on Cleveland, the 2016 Republican National Convention.

[דובר 1] (34:25 - 34:35)
Almost two decades after peddling conspiracy theories on late-night cable TV, All right, let's just cover this thing. Alex Jones arrived at the Republican National Convention.

[דובר 8] (34:36 - 34:43)
That summer was particularly important for Jones because he was on the rise at the time.

[דובר 30] (34:43 - 34:46)
I come to see Alex Jones. Put that on CNN.

[דובר 14] (34:50 - 35:18)
Normally, you would expect Alex Jones to be outside the barricades with a bullhorn. But all of a sudden, there he was, making his way through. He was a part of things because this was an administration that not only embraces people like him and like Roger Stone and people who were kind of, you know, practicing the sort of conspiratorial dark arts, conspiratorial thinking is a feature of this president.

[דובר 1] (35:20 - 35:30)
Inside the convention, Jones immediately sought out controversy. He crashed the set of a live left-wing television show.

[דובר 31] (35:30 - 35:33)
I believe that it overcomes every other democratic advantage.

[דובר 8] (35:41 - 36:00)
Jones had a contentious relationship with the Young Turks. They both decided to interrupt their live show. There were people everywhere.

And I remember trying to hold my camera up to film what was going on. There were people scrambling everywhere, people screaming at each other.

[דובר 28] (36:01 - 36:03)
I mean, it was a spectacle.

[דובר 8] (36:04 - 36:21)
It was ridiculous. But, I mean, honestly, that was par for the course. That was daily life with Jones.

For him, it was always like, let's create chaos. Because chaos is entertaining, people are going to tune into that.

[דובר 5] (36:23 - 36:40)
And they just decided to go for it. They had a preternatural sense that that would be a big to-do. The objective is always to get clicks, to get eyeballs, and to convert that into financial gain.

[דובר 1] (36:41 - 36:51)
Chaos. Conflict. Conspiracy.

In 2016, Jones and Stone were rewriting the playbook of American politics.

[דובר 14] (36:52 - 37:04)
And that was another moment where you realize this whole landscape has changed. And these individuals that could so easily be dismissed have become a force to be reckoned with.

[דובר 1] (37:11 - 37:18)
With Election Day looming, on Infowars, Jones went all in attacking Hillary Clinton.

[דובר 6] (37:19 - 37:33)
People loved this conspiracist claim. If he needed more to lock her up, he was the more. But it was really a portrait of her as a woman who would do anything.

Anything.

[דובר 2] (37:33 - 37:45)
I will warn you, this story that's been the biggest thing on the Internet is a rabbit hole that is horrifying to go down. Now, this is tied into Podesta with thousands of emails with, we're going to have the six-year-old, the seven-year-old.

[דובר 1] (37:45 - 37:59)
It was an Internet conspiracy theory, sparked by stolen emails from Clinton's campaign chairman, John Podesta, claiming that references to cheese pizza were code for child pornography.

[דובר 28] (37:59 - 38:10)
Why did the Podesta emails mention the code word pasta for either little boy or sex 78 times? Code word cheese for little girl 85 times?

[דובר 3] (38:10 - 38:13)
They were ready to believe just about anything about Hillary Clinton.

[דובר 28] (38:13 - 38:17)
Do you think I'll do better playing dominoes on cheese than on pasta?

[דובר 3] (38:17 - 38:40)
The belief that evildoers are meeting in secret to abuse children is really old. The blood libel, the best-known example of that is from the Middle Ages. The idea that Jews were meeting in secret to murder Christian children and use their blood in rituals.

And we can see elements of the blood libel in a lot of conspiracy theories even through the present day.

[דובר 1] (38:41 - 38:45)
On Twitter, they called the blood libel hashtag Pizzagate.

[דובר 3] (38:46 - 38:49)
Pizzagate has elements of blood libel within it.

[דובר 1] (38:50 - 38:59)
The allegation? Child sex ring run out of the basement of a D.C. pizza parlor. So comment ping pong.

Comment ping pong.

[דובר 2] (38:59 - 39:07)
WikiLeaks have come out with Podesta going to rituals where they drink blood and urine and semen.

[דובר 19] (39:08 - 39:13)
Oh my gosh. Jones is having the time of his life.

[דובר 2] (39:13 - 39:15)
Yes, I have a responsibility to cover it and yes, it's important.

[דובר 19] (39:16 - 39:24)
I mean, he was in high dungeon. They hurt children, folks. We're covering, we're like, this is pure evil.

[דובר 2] (39:25 - 39:29)
Cover Pizzagate, we have covered it, we are covering it and all I know is God help us, we're in the hands of pure evil.

[דובר 19] (39:29 - 39:32)
And it ran constantly because it was a ratings getter.

[דובר 2] (39:33 - 39:41)
When I think about all the children Hillary Clinton has personally murdered and chopped up and raped.

[דובר 1] (39:41 - 39:51)
His profile raised by Trump and Stone. Jones was known as a super spreader. A megaphone for Internet lies and misinformation.

[דובר 2] (39:52 - 39:58)
I just can't hold back the truth anymore. Hillary Clinton is one of the most vicious serial killers the planet's ever seen.

[דובר 19] (40:00 - 40:07)
A match was struck on Alex Jones' show and it goes from 0 to 100 on Google Trends. 96 hours.

[דובר 2] (40:08 - 40:13)
Thousands of emails, I'm not ready to accuse all these people of this. It's up to you to research it for yourself.

[דובר 10] (40:13 - 40:21)
Yeah, I mean, Alex would always encourage people like, I can't do this alone. You know, he'd always encourage people to go out and do those things by themselves.

[דובר 1] (40:23 - 40:26)
Some of them took matters into their own hands.

[דובר 7] (40:27 - 40:45)
Girls! A volunteer firefighter in North Carolina, Edgar Madison Welsh, hears the stories about Pizzagate being promoted by Alex Jones and others and decides somebody has to do something about it. Somebody has to save these kids.

[דובר 19] (40:48 - 40:58)
I'd let go of anything in this world. He's basically making a goodbye video. His two daughters, like, in the car, on the way, driving north on 95.

[דובר 27] (41:00 - 41:02)
I can't let you curve up in the world because I'd be brought by evil.

[דובר 19] (41:03 - 41:05)
I mean, he believed it.

[דובר 27] (41:07 - 41:09)
I think I'm going to have to stay in there one day.

[דובר 7] (41:10 - 41:34)
So this guy, Welsh, armed with an assault rifle, barges into the restaurant on a Sunday afternoon fires two shots as he goes looking for the mythical basement where the kids are supposedly being trafficked. And, of course, never finds it.

[דובר 1] (41:36 - 41:49)
Welch discovered there was no basement. No pedophile ring. Welch would later tell a New York Times reporter the intel on this wasn't 100 percent.

[דובר 25] (41:50 - 42:11)
These conspiracies, some may think, well, they're harmless. But then we have somebody who shows up at a pizza establishment with a weapon. People will act on these things.

We will see violence from this sort of stirring up of hatred and division. And the Pizzagate conspiracy theory is exhibit A.

[דובר 2] (42:14 - 42:19)
I'm going to read to you from a statement that's also posted to Infowars.com that I wrote yesterday.

[דובר 1] (42:19 - 42:27)
Under legal threat from the owner of Comet Ping Pong, Alex Jones would eventually retract his Pizzagate claims.

[דובר 2] (42:28 - 42:37)
In our commentary about what had become known as Pizzagate, I made comments that in hindsight I regret and for which I apologize to him.

[דובר 1] (42:43 - 43:04)
Alex Jones had become a powerful and dangerous voice. His influence confirmed with the inauguration in 2017. He'd reached the center of American politics and power.

[דובר 18] (43:19 - 43:24)
This is a giant playground for fans of conspiracy theories.

[דובר 1] (43:24 - 43:39)
Conspiracy theories were now emanating directly from the White House. As president, Trump veered from one unsupported claim to the next.

[דובר 4] (43:46 - 44:01)
President Trump is someone who has realized that conspiracy theories work for him. If he's going to be able to keep his base happy, he has to continue to feed them red meat and that red meat consists a lot of times of conspiracy theories.

[דובר 17] (44:01 - 44:15)
If you have a windmill anywhere near your house, they say the noise causes cancer. You tell me that one. The windmills cause cancer.

But for fact's sake, that is just not true. There was no collision, there was no obstruction, everybody knows it.

[דובר 22] (44:16 - 44:26)
It's all a big hoax I call it the witch hunt. It's all a big hoax. A deal to Russia with Clinton help and Obama administration knowledge is the biggest story that fake media does.

[דובר 1] (44:27 - 44:28)
Jones was on a high.

[דובר 2] (44:29 - 44:41)
They write my stuff in the speeches and Trump approves it. It's like with Trump, he goes, okay, yeah, that's right. And then the conversation with Trump, I start talking, he finishes the sentence, I finish the sentence.

It's weird, man. It's weird.

[דובר 13] (44:42 - 45:10)
And so someone like Alex Jones, who can come in with wild theories and Donald Trump repeats it as fact. You have newspapers printing it as fact. You have media and television shows repeating it as though it's fact.

And then you have Donald Trump tweeting it as though it's fact. We are in a position where many Americans are susceptible to not just false information but lies that they believe is truth.

[דובר 1] (45:13 - 45:16)
But with influence came a new level of scrutiny.

[דובר 6] (45:17 - 45:24)
We'd raise your right hand, please. You do solemnly swear that the testimony you're about to give will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.

[דובר 1] (45:24 - 45:29)
Got it. Those parents from Sandy Hook had been pursuing him in court.

[דובר 16] (45:30 - 45:45)
I simply had enough and that was what needed to be done. I'm proud of bringing the lawsuit, brought a lot more attention to who he really is and what his show represents.

[דובר 9] (45:45 - 45:52)
Can you now admit that you've done an outrageous wrong to these parents? Can you admit that?

[דובר 2] (45:53 - 46:10)
You know, the mainstream media is who always takes it and makes it a huge issue and then says that I'm saying it and gets me to respond. And it's lawyers like you and people that glom onto this for fame that then try to get the fame and then say that I'm the person that's promoting it. And it's obscene in my view.

[דובר 1] (46:11 - 46:15)
It was at this point that Jones shocked Posner's attorney.

[דובר 9] (46:16 - 46:23)
Mr. Jones claimed that the reason that he said that Sandy Hook was fake was because he was suffering from a kind of psychosis.

[דובר 2] (46:24 - 46:33)
And I myself have almost had a form of psychosis back in the past where I basically thought everything was staged. You know, I've now learned a lot of times things aren't staged.

[דובר 9] (46:33 - 46:50)
Because it wasn't just about Sandy Hook. What he was saying is that there's a psychosis I have, some form of psychosis that makes me believe that every event is staged. My opinions have been wrong, but they were never wrong consciously.

In other words, for Jones, it's a universal past.

[דובר 1] (46:51 - 46:54)
Under oath, Jones made a reluctant admission.

[דובר 2] (46:55 - 47:10)
And so over the years, I've, you know, especially as it became a huge issue, had time to, you know, really retrospectively think about it. And as the whole thing matured, you know, I had a chance to believe that children died and it's a tragedy.

[דובר 1] (47:11 - 47:18)
Judges in Texas and Connecticut would go on to rule against him and find him financially liable.

[דובר 7] (47:20 - 47:38)
One would have thought he might have been chastened by the legal action. But he's still out there. He's still peddling his various vitamin dietary supplements and still promoting these crazy conspiracy theories.

[דובר 1] (47:39 - 47:59)
By 2020, Alex Jones was exploiting another tragedy, the coronavirus pandemic. The fire of conspiracies he had been stoking was raging.

[דובר 22] (48:00 - 48:08)
But they want to keep us locked in our homes. This is a CHICOM laboratory experiment. Total population control.

[דובר 3] (48:08 - 48:15)
What we are seeing during COVID is that there is a humongous outgrowth of specific conspiracy theories.

[דובר 30] (48:15 - 48:23)
Nothing has made elected Democrats more powerful than the COVID pandemic. They began as politicians. Lockdowns made them God.

[דובר 3] (48:24 - 48:26)
Everything from wearing a mask to social distancing.

[דובר 34] (48:27 - 48:35)
This has never, Sean, been about following the science. It's never been about following the facts and the truth. It's been about control from day one.

[דובר 3] (48:35 - 48:37)
About vaccines and vaccination.

[דובר 32] (48:37 - 48:46)
We are on the verge against all science of mandating vaccines for children. That we are on the verge of East German style show me your papers.

[דובר 6] (48:48 - 49:10)
A lot of people who might very well have masked or taken vaccines have been propagandized into not doing it. And the result has been a hospitalization crisis that need not have occurred. A death toll that didn't have to be a death toll.

[דובר 1] (49:19 - 49:37)
For years, Alex Jones, Roger Stone, and Donald Trump had been pushing conspiracies. Connecting them to mainstream politics. It all climaxed on one day.

January 6th.

[דובר 7] (49:37 - 49:49)
In many ways, January 6th was the inevitable consequence. The inevitable logical outcome of the conspiracy theories that they were all spreading.

[דובר 1] (49:50 - 49:52)
They had a new conspiracy theory.

[דובר 17] (49:52 - 50:00)
They rigged an election. They rigged it like they've never rigged an election before. We won in a landslide.

This was a landslide.

[דובר 42] (50:01 - 50:09)
The president pushed one bizarre conspiracy theory after another. One lie after another.

[דובר 17] (50:09 - 50:14)
Make no mistake, this election was stolen from you, from me, from the country.

[דובר 3] (50:17 - 50:43)
January 6th was one of the few times that I can think of in American history where a large group of Americans literally took to the streets in support of a conspiracy theory. It was really shocking to realize not just that there were this many Americans who believed that the election had been stolen from Donald Trump, but who were prepared to commit acts of violence and vandalism in support of that.

[דובר 11] (50:49 - 51:05)
Capitol to Capitol is secure now. Tensions are still high following the chaos at the Capitol.

[דובר 6] (51:06 - 51:26)
I'm fearful that it's a prelude. Conspiracism now is not coming just from the president and his followers or conspiracy entrepreneurs, but it has become a malignant normality. And at every level of government, not just in the national government, but in the states and localities as well.

[דובר 1] (51:27 - 51:33)
A year after January 6th, Trump, Stone, and Jones remain at the center of the storm.

[דובר 26] (51:34 - 51:49)
The House Committee investigating January 6th is widening its net. New subpoenas for Trump confidant Roger Stone. Conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.

The subpoenas include demands for documents and testimony about whether they had prior knowledge about the attack.

[דובר 30] (51:49 - 51:56)
Former President Trump threatening to invoke executive privilege to block the House Committee investigating the January 6th insurrection.

[דובר 1] (51:57 - 52:01)
Undeterred, the conspiracy theories keep spreading.

[דובר 24] (52:01 - 52:06)
The January 6th insurrection didn't kill the Q conspiracy. It's emboldened it.

[דובר 32] (52:06 - 52:12)
So many individuals continue to believe what Donald Trump says and continue to believe even new conspiracy theories.

[דובר 7] (52:13 - 52:21)

Hey, did someone follow you here? Turn off your phone. To be sure, remove the battery, because we don't want them, them, to listen.

In this lecture, we're going to explore how popular culture promotes conspiracy theories and how constant exposure to these literary, TV, and cinematic narratives shape the public's perception of political events. We'll see that books, TV series, and movies play a key role in promoting conspiracies and a conspiratorial mindset. Now let's rewind a bit.

Up until the end of World War II, there were almost no books or movies about secret plots or conspiracies. There were a few spy movies, but most in Hollywood were concentrated on straightforward stories of good versus evil, like Westerns, where the sheriff faces the bad guys. These were the simple plot lines.

But in the aftermath of the war, the United States saw the emergence of the Soviet Union as a new formidable threat that marked the beginning of the Cold War. This period was characterized by really unsettling events, constant geopolitical tension, and that deeply impacted the American psyche. It cultivated a fertile ground for suspicion, for the idea of unseen adversaries, and there were actual real events that seemed to validate this notion of hidden enemies, like right here within our own borders.

In 1949, only four years after the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the Soviet Union developed their own atomic bomb. That sparked intense speculation. How did they get the knowledge so quickly?

The assumption was spies, and that was indeed the case. The trials of Soviet spies in the United States became a national sensation, fueling widespread fear of communist infiltration. The idea that hidden threats were undermining national security from within.

This paranoia extended to the belief that even neighbors or acquaintances could be part of a covert conspiracy. Such fears became the driving force behind the House Un-American Activities Committee, investigations led by Senator Joseph McCarty, and aggressive persecution of anyone suspected of communist sympathize. That shift from purely external threats to internal ones is the key ingredient in the conspiracy narratives that followed, narratives that almost immediately found their ways into movies.

The menace took form of spies, union workers, and even aliens all feeding into that general atmosphere of mistrust. One such example is the invasion of the Body Snatchers from 1956. The movie tapped into Cold War fear of Soviet infiltration and mass brainwashing.

Its eerie premise that ordinary people could be secretly replaced reflected the anxieties about hidden subversion and the loss of individuality. The film helped cement the idea that conspiracies could lurk in everyday life just beneath the surface. Let us watch the movie trailer.

I'm not crazy. Make them listen to me before it's too late. Listen to me.

Please listen. If you don't, if you won't, if you fail to understand, then the same incredible terror that's menacing me will strike at you.

They come from another world, spawned in the light years of space, unleashed to take over the bodies and souls of the people of our planet, bringing a new dimension in terror to the giant super scope screen.

[דובר 2] (4:11 - 4:21)
Whatever intelligence or instinct it is that can govern the forming of human flesh and blood out of thin air is fantastically powerful. Beyond any comprehension.

[דובר 3] (4:24 - 4:28)
A cursed, dreadful, malevolent thing was happening to those he loved.

[דובר 2] (4:29 - 4:39)
This isn't just an ordinary body, is it? I never saw one like it. It looks...

unused.

The sensational star discovery of the view from Poppy's head. And now an undreamed of horror makes her life and love a vortex of fear.

[דובר 9] (4:50 - 4:57)
Jack! Miles, where do they come from?

[דובר 8] (4:58 - 5:11)
I don't know. Suddenly, while you're asleep, they'll absorb your minds, your memories. I don't want any part of it.

You're forgetting something, Miles. What's that? You have no choice.

[דובר 3] (5:12 - 5:20)
From city to city, an incredible hysterical panic spreads. As the unimaginable becomes real, the impossible becomes true.

[דובר 6] (5:21 - 5:34)
Stop and listen! Stop and listen to me! Listen!

Listen! Listen to me! They're not human!

Can't you see? Everyone! They're here already!

Let's fast forward a bit to the Kennedy era. The Manchurian candidate from 1962 brought Cold War paranoia to a new level, portraying a US soldier brainwashed into becoming an unwitting political assassin. With its chilling depiction of mind control, communist plots and elite manipulation, the film fed directly into the fears of hidden influence and subversion at the highest levels of power.

It made the idea of political conspiracy feel not just possible, but terrifyingly close to home. The assassination of President Kennedy in November 1963, especially against that backdrop of the Cold War and the events of Vietnam, made people reject the official findings of the Warren Commission that investigated the murder and seek alternative speculative explanations to President Kennedy's assassination. By the 1960s, we witnessed a rise in movies with conspiracy plots.

Some raised concerns of enemies from within, while others pointed towards external enemies. In 7 Days in May, the enemy comes from within, in the form of a potential military coup. But in the James Bond films, one of the most popular franchises in cinematic history, the enemy is an international organization.

From Dr. No in 1962 till On Her Majesty's Secret Service from 1969, Bond must confront Spectre, a global criminal organization which manipulates world events for power and profit. These movies reflect classic conspiratorial thinking by portraying a shadowy elite manipulating governments and global events. It reinforces the idea that hidden forces, not visible institutions, truly control the world.

Then came the 1970s, a decade dominated by military coups in South America and Africa, Watergate, a global economic crisis, and the spread of international terror led by organizations such as the Irish IRA, the Palestinian PLO, and ETA in Spain, and many, many more. Real world events were mirroring the kind of plots previously confined to fiction. In the United States, Watergate fundamentally shadowed public trust in government and its institutions in a way that few events before had.

It created this societal environment where the idea of large-scale conspiracies orchestrated at the highest levels of power felt not only plausible, but for many people almost expected. And movies reflected that profound shift with The Vengeance. For example, in The Parallax View from 1974, a reporter discovers a shadowy corporation, the Parallax Corporation, that appears to recruit and train political assassins.

After watching the film, there is a feeling that you cannot trust anyone and that the truth is constantly being manipulated. Even stronger, Three Days of the Condor in 1975 tapped into that post-Watergate paranoia, not being able to trust even your own side. A CIA researcher uncovering a deadly conspiracy within the agency itself.

That film amplified the pervasive theme of betrayal. It presented the chilling realization that the very people inside institutions meant to protect you might be the ones you have the most reasons to fear. Let us watch the movie trailer.

[דובר 6] (9:24 - 9:28)
Miss Turner, I work for you. What is your designation? Uh, Condor.

[דובר 2] (9:31 - 9:59)
What level? Level. Level of damage?

Everybody. Dr. Lapp, Janus, Ray, Harold. Everybody is dead.

Condor is an amateur. He's lost. Unpredictable.

He could fool a professional. I work for the CIA. I am not a spy.

I just read books. We have games. We play games.

What if? Seven people killed.

[דובר 4] (10:02 - 10:03)
I'll need your help.

[דובר 8] (10:03 - 10:05)
Have I ever denied you anything?

[דובר 4] (10:07 - 10:10)
Do you believe the Condor is really an endangered species?

[דובר 8] (10:10 - 10:12)
Don't expect too many mistakes from this man.

Robert Redford returned a year later in All the President's Men, which you are already familiar with. In that movie, fiction and reality blend together. It's a movie, but it's also real.

Nixon did try to win an election by breaking the law and covering everything up. There was a real conspiracy, and seeing it on the big screen only makes it more real for many. By the 1980s, a wave of conservative leadership has taken hold across the Western world.

Ronald Reagan was President of the United States, Helmut Kohl served as the Chancellor of West Germany, and Margaret Thatcher led Great Britain. These leaders shared a deep skepticism of centralized power and advanced the belief that government is not the solution to society's problem, it is the problem. This ideology fueled a growing mistrust of political institutions, portraying government as bloated, overreaching, and fundamentally disconnected from the people it claims to represent.

It set the stage for a broader cultural narrative that questioned the legitimacy of official authority and empowering populist, even conspiratorial, thinking. This distrust in government found vivid expression in popular culture, especially in films like First Blood from 1982 and its sequel Rambo First Blood Part 2 in 1985. John Rambo, a traumatized Vietnam veteran, is portrayed not as a mindless killer, but as a symbol of betrayal by a government that used him and then cast him aside.

The second film in particular advances the idea that the U.S. could have won the Vietnam War if not for the political inference. In one telling exchange, when Rambo is recruited to rescue American POWs, he asks, do we get to win this time? His commanding officer replies, this time, it's up to you.

The message is clear, soldiers were never truly defeated, only held back by weak, untrustworthy leaders. Rambo becomes a symbol of individual heroism, stifled by cowardly politicians and bureaucrats whose interests are not the interests of the people. A similar narrative runs through the early Jason Bourne novels by Robert Ludlam, The Bourne Identity, The Bourne Supremacy, and The Bourne Ultimatum, where a patriotic government-trained assassin with amnesia uncovers that his own agency turned against him.

In all these narratives, the message is clear, the greatest enemy is not another country, but the people running it. The 1990s marked a turning point where conspiracy thinking moved from the fringes to the mainstream, fueled by real-world events and amplified through pop culture. Incidents like the Waco siege and Ruby Ridge, two deadly standoffs between U.S. federal agents and American citizens, shook public confidence in federal law enforcement, reinforcing the idea that government agencies were not just fallible, but actively dangerous, willing to kill their own citizens in the name of control. These events became flashpoints for anti-government sentiment, lending credibility to fears of hidden agendas and deepening the beliefs that dissent was being deliberately silenced. At the same time, UFO conspiracies, especially those surrounding Roswell, New Mexico, the place called Area 51, saw a dramatic resurgence, grounded in belief that the government had long concealed contacts with extraterrestrials. These stories thrived on the idea of a vast, coordinated cover-up meticulously maintained to keep the truth from the public.

Films like The Truman Show and The Matrix captured a growing cultural distrust of institutions and reality itself. The Truman Show portrayed a man unknowingly trapped in a fabricated world echoing fears of total surveillance and media deception. The Matrix pushed this further, suggesting that all reality is a simulation controlled by hidden powers.

Looking at decades of conspiratorial narratives in popular culture, one clear effect is the normalization of conspiracy thinking as a way of understanding the world. Films and TV often present these theories like a puzzle to be solved, inviting audiences to follow clues, uncover hidden truths, and even through official lies, much like The Da Vinci Code by Dan Brown or Foucault's Pendulum by Umberto Eco. This sense of decoding reality not only makes conspiracies intellectually and emotionally appealing, but also creates a shared identity for those who see the truth.

Conspiracy thinking, in many ways, becomes its own genre defined by a populist narrative of ordinary people versus a shadowy elite. Yet, there's a paradox. For all their complexity, these stories often arrive at predictable conclusions that reinforce existing beliefs.

The world becomes a web of hidden meanings and the real danger lies in what must be part of one. No cultural text captured and sustained the conspiratorial imagination quite like The X-Files, a TV series that ran from 1993 till 2002. Centered on two FBI agents, Fox Mulder and Donna Scully, the series blurred the line between science fiction and political thriller, with each episode peeling back the layers of an elaborate government cover-up Its iconic tagline, the truth is out there, became a cultural mantra, encapsulating the series' central theme, that powerful institutions are hiding the truth and only a few brave individuals dare to uncover it. Week after week, the show invited audiences to share in its pursuit, fostering a mindset of deep skepticism towards authority in the media space, but for its time, the plot and production was quite revolutionary. Here is a short taste of it.

[דובר 7] (16:57 - 17:02)
Agent Scully, thank you for coming on such short notice, please. How'd you come to work for the FBI?

[דובר 5] (17:02 - 17:05)
I saw the FBI as a place where I could distinguish myself.

[דובר 8] (17:05 - 17:08)
Are you familiar with an agent named Fox Mulder?

[דובר 5] (17:09 - 17:21)
He's an Oxford-educated psychologist who wrote a monograph on serial killers and the occult that helped catch Monty Props in 1988, generally thought of as the best analyst in the violent crime section.

[דובר 7] (17:21 - 17:24)
Are you familiar with the so-called X-Files?

[דובר 5] (17:25 - 17:28)
I believe they have to do with unexplained phenomena.

[דובר 7] (17:35 - 17:46)
More or less. The reason you're here, Agent Scully, is we want you to assist Mulder on these X-Files. You will write field reports on your activities along with your observations on the validity of the work.

[דובר 5] (17:48 - 17:52)
Major Mulder, I'm Dana Scully. I've been assigned to work with you.

[דובר 4] (17:53 - 17:59)
Oh, isn't it nice to be suddenly so highly regarded. So who did you take off to get stuck with this detail, Scully?

[דובר 5] (18:00 - 18:03)
If you have any data about my qualifications or credentials...

[דובר 4] (18:03 - 18:53)
You're a medical doctor. You teach at the academy. You did your undergraduate degree in physics.

It's just that in most of my work, the laws of physics rarely seem to apply. When convention and science offer us no answers, might we not finally turn to the fantastic as a plausibility? Do you believe in the existence of extraterrestrials?

[דובר 1] (19:05 - 20:31)
What made the X-Files especially influential was not just its subject matter but its tone. Serious, brooding, often paranoid. It suggested that conspiracies weren't just possible, they were routine.

The government was not only hiding the existence of extraterrestrials but also experimenting on its own citizens, manipulating public memory and working with unknown global forces. These ideas resonated powerfully with the public already shaken by real-world scandals and geopolitical uncertainty. As one of the longest-running and most-watched shows of the decade, the X-Files didn't merely reflect conspiratorial thinking, it helped shape it giving conspiracy culture a serialized mainstream platform that reached millions.

In sum, what began as a Cold War paranoia evolved into a full-fledged cultural genre. Popular culture hasn't just reflected public distrust in institutions, it has amplified it turning suspicion into spectacle. From sprite thrillers to sci-fi dystopias, these narratives reinforce the idea that hidden forces control our world.

While some skepticism is healthy, constant exposure to conspiratorial thinking risks blurring the line between truth and fiction until everything starts to look like a cover-up. So, if they come for you, I was never here.

Hi. Every election season, politicians take to podiums and airwaves with a flurry of promises. They vow to boost the economy, reform healthcare, fight corruption, bring peace, and much more.

There is a persistent public cynicism about campaign promises. The old idea that politicians will say anything to get elected, like former American President George H.W. Bush, who famously said in 1988, read my lips, no new taxes, only to break his promise two years later. These campaign promises are more than just lofty rhetoric during a heated campaign.

They are signals to voters about what candidates intend to do if given power. Voters use these pledges as a yardstick to decide whom to support and later judge whether their leaders delivered on what was promised. Yet, as common experience and countless jokes suggest, promises made on the campaign trail often prove tricky to fulfill once the election is over.

Why is that? Today, we'll explore what campaign promises really are, why they're frequently hard to keep, why politicians still make them, and how all of this impacts public trust and the political process. Let's begin by asking, what exactly are campaign promises?

Simply put, they are the commitments candidates make to voters during an election. These can range from specific policy pledges like, I will raise the minimum wage, to broad goals like, we'll create millions of jobs, or guiding principles such as, I will oppose tax increases. Promises appear in speeches, manifestos, debates, social media, and even on posters.

Some are concrete, while others are more visionary and are meant to inspire. Why do they matter? Because they underpin democratic accountability.

Voters choose candidates whose promises align with their preferences, effectively giving them a mandate. If the winner delivers on these promises, democracy is working. If not, voters may feel betrayed and respond in the next election.

In that sense, campaign promises make an informal contract between a politician and the public. The practice is universal. From American presidents to legislators in Asia, candidates are expected to declare their intentions.

Campaign promises act as signals, helping voters understand the candidates' priorities. As political scientist Colleen Shogan puts it, they often offer a blueprint for future policy. Even in an age of photo ops and empty soundbites, laying out promises still shapes what governments do after winning.

Of course, not all promises are equal. Specific ones, like, I will pass a law that does X or Y, are easier to track. Vague ones, such as, America's best days are yet to come, are harder to judge, and politicians know this.

Research shows that candidates often use strategic vagueness, especially when worried about backlash. This creates a paradox. Voters want clarity, but punish failure, so candidates try to strike a balance, mixing grand visions with just enough ambiguity to remain flexible once in office.

So, once elected, why can't leaders just snap their fingers and deliver on their promises? As the saying goes, campaigning is poetry, but governing is prose. Campaigns are filled with lofty, inspiring language, but governing means grappling with the hard realities of writing laws, balancing budgets, and navigating complex institutions.

The first major challenge is political and institutional obstacles. No leader governs alone. Presidents and prime ministers need the support of legislators or coalition partners to enact their agenda.

A candidate might promise sweeping climate reforms, for example, only to see the bill blocked in the Senate. That doesn't necessarily mean they were dishonest. It often reflects political gridlock.

Research on the U.S. presidents showed that broken promises usually result from lack of congressional support, not betrayal. In parliamentary systems, the same dynamics apply. If a party can't form a majority and must build a coalition, some promises are watered down or abandoned.

In Israel, for instance, many parties pledge to draft ultra-Orthodox men onto the military, but drop the demand when ultra-Orthodox parties refuse to join their coalition. In short, the messy business of governing often overrides even the most sincere campaign commitments. A second reason campaign promises often go unfulfilled is economic and practical constraints.

Money matters. A candidate might pledge bold new programs or sweeping tax cuts, but once in office, they face the cold reality of budgets. If the economy takes a downturn or unexpected crisis hits, like the Greek economic crisis or a pandemic, priorities shift and promises get shelved.

Often, candidates are simply too optimistic about what the budget can bear. A third reason are legal and constitutional limits. Some promises run up against laws, jurisdictional boundaries, or court rulings.

A presidential candidate may vow sweeping educational reform only to discover that in a decentralized system, education policy is largely controlled at the regional level. In Spain, for example, national politicians have repeatedly promised changes to language or educational policy only to find that the Spanish constitution grants significant autonomy to regions like Catalonia or Debas County. Attempts to centralize control or override regional decisions often face fierce legal and political resistance.

Sometimes the obstacle isn't a lack of will, but a lack of legal authority. Next is over promising and the complexity of governing. Campaigns thrive on bold, simple pledges.

We will become energy independent, or I will bring peace and security. But these are far harder to implement. In Israel, for instance, many leaders have promised to achieve security and peace, but deep-rooted historical grievances, security concerns, and political fragmentation on both sides make any lasting agreement extraordinarily difficult to deliver.

Given all these challenges, why do politicians keep making grand promises? It can feel almost cruel, raising hopes only to find that reality crushes them. Are they just cynical manipulators?

Not quite. There are several reasons why politicians continue to make ambitious campaign promises even when they know the constraints. First, they do so to win support.

Elections are about persuasion, and promises are a candidate's way of saying, here's what I'll do for you. Voters tend to respond to concrete pledges even if they suspect delivery might be difficult. If one candidate offers a bold vision and another stays vague, the bold one often wins attention.

This doesn't mean that they will also win the election. That depends if the policies they promote are favored by voters. Campaigns are competitions of ideas, and refusing to promise anything can look like having no plan at all.

Politicians are, in a sense, pushed by the electoral logic to make promises. It's how they connect with voters. Second, promises signal values.

They're not just a list of future policies. They tell voters what a candidate cares about. A vow to fight climate change or oppose tax hikes may not be fully realized, but it shows a candidate's orientation.

This kind of signaling helps voters choose someone whose priorities match their own. Even a symbolic promise is met. Saying, I'll never raise taxes, for instance, doesn't just outline policy.

It conveys an entire worldview. A third reason politicians make promises they cannot keep has to do with the fact that many politicians genuinely do want and hope to achieve what they promise. Campaign pledges often reflect these goals.

A candidate who vows to fix the roads or expand education likely does care about those issues. And despite widespread cynicism, research consistently shows that many promises are actually kept. Studies across democracies, including Canada, the UK, the Netherlands, and other countries, suggest that roughly two-thirds of promises are fulfilled, at least in part.

We tend to focus on the dramatic failures, but the quiet follow-through is more common than we think. The fourth reason is that promises also serve a strategic purpose. They may be the opening move in a negotiation.

A candidate may promise a $15 minimum wage knowing they're likely set up for $12, but by starting high, they shift the debate. Promises can also signal intent to allies, interest groups, or coalition partners. By stating a position publicly, politicians create pressure on themselves and others to deliver.

Signing pledges, like a pledge made in 2013 by Israeli politicians Naftali Bennett and Yair Lapid not to join a coalition with ultra-Orthodox parties, serve both as a tool to gain trust and demonstrate seriousness, and force Prime Minister Netanyahu to agree to their demand. Finally, promises respond to voter demands, even when the promise seems unrealistic. Some voters take campaign pledges literally, and politicians know this.

Even if a candidate knows their proposal won't pass, making the promise can tap into real public sentiment. When such a promise gains traction, it tells the political system this idea matters to people. In this way, even unfulfilled promises can shape policy debates.

A sweeping pledge for health care reform, for instance, might never become a law, but if it energizes voters and moves the conversation, it has impact. Voters want to be told there are better days ahead. They want to be inspired, even if it requires a candidate to lie.

Case in point, U.S. presidential candidate Walter Mondale. In 1984, Mondale wanted to be honest and told the public that before the economy will do better, the situation is going to get worse. He lost in one of the biggest landlines to President Ronald Reagan, whose optimistic tone resonated much better with voters.

So what effect do all these kept and broken promises have on the public and on democracy itself? Campaign promises are central to democratic representation. When politicians fulfill them, it reinforces public trust, validating the electoral process and suggesting that leaders are responsible and accountable.

Studies show that fulfilled promises can boost trust in government, particularly among voters already predisposed to support the ruling party. This effect is strongest when citizens view promise-keeping as important or have been generally satisfied with government performance. But when promises are broken, especially clearly or repeatedly, they can fuel deep cynicism.

A broken promise can feel less like a policy failure and more like a personal betrayal. Psychologically, betrayal strikes harder than ordinary disappointment. If a politician pledges something important and fails to follow through, voters may feel cheated, not just let down.

When Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard introduced a carbon pricing scheme after explicitly promising there would be no carbon tax, the backlash was swift and intense, damaging her credibility and fueling voter resentment. This corrodes trust, not only in that leader, but in politics as a whole. The result can be apathy, disillusionment, or a turn toward anti-establishment candidates who promise to clean the house.

Research shows that voters rank breaking campaign promises as one of the strongest triggers of political distrust, even more than personal scandals or legal misdeeds. Broken promises also become potent political ammunition. Opponents repeatedly highlight them.

Remember when you promised X? And the fear of such backlash shapes political strategy. The shadow of past betrayals lingers long.

George W. Bush's no new taxes reversal remains a textbook example, as does Ariel Sharon's post-election disengagement from Gaza, which upset many Israeli voters who felt misled by his silence to talk about the issue in his 2003 campaign. Yet voters are not entirely unforgiving.

Many recognize that not all promises can be kept, especially in complex or rapidly changing circumstances. Economic crisis, coalition constraints, or unforeseen global events can make certain pledges unfeasible or unwise. What matters, research suggests, is how leaders break their promises.

If the reasons are communicated clearly and credibly, the political cost may be lower. But when the broken promise appears disingenuous from the outset, or when no serious attempt was made to fulfill it, voters respond much more harshly. Importantly, how voters interpret broken or kept promises is also shaped by partisanship.

As research conducted in the USA by Tabitha Bonilla demonstrates, co-partisans tend to rationalize or downplay broken promises, while out-partisans are less likely to reward even fulfilled ones. Zloysner and Amsalem, who studied the issue in Israel, further showed that broken promises primarily affect domain-specific evaluations, such as voters' views on the candidate's performance on education or health, but not the overall leader approval, especially when voters hold strong prior opinions of these politicians. Citizens engage in decoupling, separating the broken promise from a general performance, or rationalization that justifies the breach of trust when the politician belongs to their preferred camp.

Moreover, polarized issues like immigration amplify partisan filtering, while less polarizing issues like human trafficking invite more bipartisan evaluations. Taken together, the effects of campaign promises on public trust and democratic legitimacy are far from uniform. Fulfilled promises can enhance credibility and accountability, while broken ones, depending on context, content, and communication, can erode faith in both leaders and institutions.

Understanding how voters process these dynamics is essential for grasping the fragile relationship between electoral rhetoric and democratic accountability. Now move along to watch one of the most fascinating campaigns of the 21st century, the campaign over Brexit. Enjoy.

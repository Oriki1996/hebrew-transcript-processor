An old saying goes, how can you tell if a politician is lying? The answer? When he is moving his lips.

In this lecture, we will explore these lies and their impact on society. Across history, and especially over the last couple of decades, politicians have been caught in lies of various shapes and sizes. Broadly, we can group these falsehoods into three categories.

The first category is lies about personal life and credentials. In a world where image is everything, some politicians have taken the liberty to reinvent themselves from scratch to get elected or re-elected. Take U.S. Congressman George Santos, for example. Elected in 2022, Santos fabricated nearly his entire life story. He faked his college record and his career record, even claimed he was Jewish, the grandson of Holocaust survivors. When these lies came to light through press investigations, they destroyed his credibility and career.

Likewise, in Germany, a series of high-profile politicians have been undone by dishonest credentials. Karl Theodor Zugudenberg, once Germany's most popular defense minister and a rising star, was found to have plagiarized large portions of his Ph.D. thesis. In 2011, amid front-page allegations and an outcry over his academic dishonesty, Zugudenberg had his doctorate revoked and resigned in ministerial post-disgrace.

The second category of lies are weaponized false statements aimed at opponents or marginalized groups. We already mentioned during the semester the claim made by Donald Trump that Barack Obama was born in Kenya and therefore cannot serve as president, or his claim that in Springfield immigrants are eating people's pets. False claims about opponents need not rise to the level of conspiracy theory to be effective.

Sometimes they're simple smear tactics. In election seasons across the globe, it's sadly common to hear spurious accusations. Shimon Peres, the former leader of Israel's Labor Party, was accused as being the son of an Arab woman.

Moreover, during the 1996 campaign against Benjamin Netanyahu, the latter accused Peres without any evidence that Peres will give half of Jerusalem to the Palestinians. Netanyahu weaponized lies again in 2015 when he claimed that Arab voters are heading to the polls in droves, a lie urging his right-wing supporters to vote to counterbalance this effect. The statement, made on election day, was widely criticized, both domestically and internationally, for being racist and inciting fear against Israel-Arab citizens.

Critics argued that it delegitimized Arab political participation. The last category of political lying is the kind that might be the most damaging in the long run, lies about objective reality, about the facts on which citizens are supposed to base their decisions. When politicians engage in this kind of lying, they are essentially asking the public to disbelieve what is true, or believe what is false, simply because they said so.

This contributes to what some have dubbed as the post-truth era, where feelings or partisan alliance can matter more than factual accuracy. In more recent years, we've seen other reality-bending claims from politicians. During the COVID-19 pandemic, for example, Brazil President Jair Bolsonaro repeatedly downplayed the severity of the virus, peddling unproven cures and claiming that vaccines could turn people into crocodiles or cause women to grow beards, statements with no basis in scientific reality.

These kinds of statements may sound funny, but many people who trusted their president refused to take the vaccine and died. Having surveyed the landscape of political lies, we must ask, what impact do they have on society? Why should we care so much that politicians lie?

One immediate answer is that democracy runs on trust. As philosopher Cicela Bock noted, trust is the atmosphere in which all human interaction thrives. When leaders routinely lie, they corrode that atmosphere.

Citizens start to assume all politicians are liars, wary of cynicism at best or outright contempt at worst. In fact, we've seen a worrying decline in public trust across many democracies in the past few decades, and the prevalence of political falsehoods is a key factor. Research by Darren Likler and Marta Perez-Escolar specifically link the spread of political misinformation to declining trust in politicians and the democratic system.

In their 2023 study of British and Spanish political leader statements, they found a shocking amount of probably false claims. Nearly two-thirds of the suspicious statements analyzed were either outright lies or what they termed bullshit, a frank academic term for assertions made with no regard for truth. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the study also noted that right-wing party leaders generated more falsehoods than left-wing ones, or at least they were fact-checked and found false more often, especially when attacking opponents or defending their own policies.

The sheer flow of misinformation from leaders, Likler explains, is a blight on societies. It leads to mistrust of facts, media, and institutions. When people hear lies from those in power, and they hear other politicians or media voices call those eyes out, the result can be a kind of information vertigo.

Truth is no longer factual, but rather a thing each side of the political aisle claims to hold. This dynamic has clearly fueled political polarization. If supporters dismiss any criticism of their politician as biased or fake, then liars pay little price for lying.

Indeed, the more brazen the lie, the more it signals to loyalists that their leader is fighting some grand battle against the establishment. Meanwhile, opponents grow even more outraged at the disconnect from reality, and many retaliate with exaggerated claims of their own. And as we shall see in the last class, while fact-checkers and the media try to find the truth, the truth is often elusive or is found much too late to make a difference.

A vivid example occurred during the 2025 conflict between India and Pakistan, when politicians and media on both sides spread widely conflicting stories. Indian outlets falsely claimed major military victories and political chaos in Pakistan, while Pakistani media retaliated with fabricated footage and exaggerated claims of their own. With each side insisting on their own version of reality, ordinary citizens were left unsure whom to believe, trapped in a fog of nationalistic misinformation.

This leads us to our last topic. Why do some countries seem to force lying politicians to resign in shame, while in other places serial liars continue to win elections? Part of the answer lies in cultural norms about honesty, accountability, and the very concept of truth.

Joseph Heinrich's book, The Weirdest People in the World, argues that Western, educated, industrialized, rich, and democratic societies, or weird societies, have developed a rather peculiar psychology compared to most of human history. Weird cultures are highly individualistic, and place strong emphasis on universal rules and abstract principles, like the idea that lying is morally wrong, regardless of who is involved. People in weird societies tend to value impartiality.

They believe leaders should treat everyone fairly, and that nepotism and favoritism are wrong. There is a premium on personal conscience, guilt, and internal feeling of moral failing when one violates a rule, which is a major driver of behavior in weird contexts. Consequently, a politician raised in such a culture might feel personally guilt-ridden for telling a lie, even if no one else immediately knows it, and if they are caught, they and their supporters are likelier to view the lying as a serious breach of an important principle, in this case, honesty.

Think of the German minister, Gutenberg, who resigned over plagiarism. In a different milieu, perhaps in Bangladesh or Paraguay, copying some thesis pages might be shrugged off, but in Germany's political culture, it was a career-ending disgrace. In weird societies, the ideal, even if it's not always the reality, is that public officials must adhere to high standards of truthfulness, and if they don't, they ought to be held accountable.

By contrast, many non-weird societies operate on somewhat different social principles. Around much of the world, cultures are more collectivist, and social harmony or loyalty can be valued over abstract consistency. Einrich notes that in most non-weird societies, shame, the public embarrassment from failing your community's expectations, weighs heavier than guilt.

What matters is not an inviolate universal rule, but who is deceiving whom and for whose benefit. In most African or Asian countries, lying to outsiders to protect your own family or your own group might be considered acceptable or even laudable in some contexts. In more clan-based or patronage-oriented cultures, if a politician lies to funnel benefits to their own ethnic group or region, their base might forgive or ignore the dishonesty because loyalty and results are valued over literal truthfulness.

Additionally, nepotism or favoritism, which in the Western societies are seen as corruption, can be seen as normal responsibility in other societies because you're expected to help your own. In such environments, the public might expect a certain amount of deceit or half-truths from leaders. Telling people what they want to hear is part of politics, not a shocking moral failure.

This doesn't mean people in non-weird countries like being lied to. Nobody truly enjoys discovering they were deceived. But the threshold for scandal can be different.

For example, in a country with a segmented media and high tribal loyalty, a leader could be caught in a lie and suffer little consequence if his core supporters feel it's more important to stick by their guy against some rival group. The lie might even be rationalized as harmless or necessary for the greater good of the community. In some authoritarian regimes, blatant lies by officials are met with popular cynicism but also with a shrug.

Citizens assume, of course the government lies, that's what they do. A form of learned helplessness where lying doesn't trigger the kind of backlash it might have caused in a democracy with a free press. As the old Russian joke goes, the politicians pretend to tell the truth and we pretend to believe them.

On the other hand, in certain honor or shame-based cultures, if a lie becomes a big public scandal, especially one that brings embarrassment on the nation, the expectation might be that the officials should resign to save face. In Japan, for instance, politicians have resigned over relatively small false statements or misrepresentations because being publicly exposed is deeply shameful. In 2018, Trader Minister Ishu Sugawara resigned after it was revealed he had lied about offering gifts to constituents, an act considered both illegal and dishonorable.

Sugawara resigned not because he felt guilty but because the public shame and expectation of accountability forced him out. In such cases, the concept of honor might play a similar role to the Western guilt, compelling a corrective action, but it operates differently, triggered by an external exposure rather than internal conscience alone. Enrich's framework highlights another interesting point.

Weird societies, those Western societies, cultivate trust in abstract institutions and strangers to a higher degree. This means that in places like Western Europe or North America, people are more likely to trust neutral fact-checkers or watchdog institutions if a politician is accused of lying. There's an ideal that truth transcends personal relationships.

In other words, even if our politician lies, truth matters more than the team. In more relationship-based societies, trust is often more personalized. People trust those in their network, their community elders, or charismatic leaders they feel connected to more than the impersonal fact-checker.

So if an authority figure says something false, their in-group might take it on faith and contrary evidence from an outsider source may be dismissed or an attack as misleading. This helps explain why, for example, in some countries populist leaders like Nicolás Maduro in Venezuela can convince masses of supporters that all the independent media are lying and he is the only one who is telling the truth, a claim that is false but resonant in a context where personal loyalty outweighs abstract verification. Of course, these are general trends.

Every country has a mix of both attitudes. And importantly, as the world globalizes, even traditionally non-weird societies have citizens demanding higher standards for transparency, just as in weird societies sometimes slide into a cynical factionalism where truth matters less than winning. Understanding these cultural differences, however, helps us see why the same lie might end a career in one nation but barely make a dent in a political support for another.

But a darker future looms if the strategy promoted by Steve Bannon, former chief strategist to Donald Trump and longtime political provocateur, becomes a global norm. Bannon famously described his media tactic as flooding the zone with shit. The idea of overwhelming the public with so many lies, half-truths, and conflicting narratives that people give up trying to find the truth at all.

This approach isn't about persuasion, it's about exhaustion, making facts feel irrelevant and cynicism feel inevitable. If more politicians adopt this playbook, we may reach a point where lies don't just divide us, they define the political game. And once that happens, rebuilding trust won't just be difficult, it may be impossible.

See you next time.

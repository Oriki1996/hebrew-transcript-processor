Bill Clinton's re-election took place in 1996, and it was a significant chapter in his political career.

[דובר 3] (0:07 - 0:24)
My fellow Americans, after these four good, hard years, I still believe in a place called hope, a place called America.

[דובר 1] (0:24 - 1:00)
Clinton's campaign heavily focused on the strong performance of the U.S. economy during his first term, and the successful implementation of the Dayton Accords, which ended the Bosnian War, adding to Clinton's foreign policy credentials. The United States experienced continued economic prosperity during Clinton's second term. Unemployment remained low, and the federal budget saw surpluses, a significant turnaround from previous deficits.

However, Bill's legacy was about to be tarnished forever.

[דובר 7] (1:00 - 1:20)
But in retrospect, the real threat to the Clinton presidency began on a quiet summer's day in 1995. It was then that a 21-year-old woman started an unpaid job here at the White House. Her name, Monica Lewinsky, and she now says that within four months of starting that job, she was having an affair with the President of the United States.

[דובר 3] (1:21 - 1:50)
And I worked on it until pretty late last night. But I want to say one thing to the American people. I want you to listen to me.

I'm going to say this again. I did not have sexual relations with that woman, Miss Lewinsky. I never told anybody to lie, not a single time, never.

These allegations are false, and I need to go back to work for the American people. Thank you.

[דובר 1] (1:56 - 2:16)
The affair reportedly took place between 1995 and 1997. Linda Tripp, a co-worker of Lewinsky's, secretly recorded conversations in which Lewinsky detailed her relationship with Clinton. Tripp later shared this information with Special Prosecutor Ken Starr.

[דובר 3] (2:16 - 2:18)
Seventeen tapes have now been handed over to the Special Prosecutor.

[דובר 2] (2:18 - 2:33)
Ken Starr was able to uncover a piece of information that he felt qualified as reason to impeach Bill Clinton, and that was that he had been having an affair with an intern, a 22-year-old Monica Lewinsky.

[דובר 5] (2:35 - 2:42)
They are the tapes that almost brought down a President. The secret recordings that made Monica Lewinsky one of the most famous women on Earth.

[דובר 1] (2:42 - 3:06)
The President initially denied the scandal for legal and political reasons. Monica Lewinsky faced intense public scrutiny. To limit the time it will take to talk to Miss Lewinsky and two others, I did not.

Sex in the Oval Office, for example, is not to be discussed. She became a central figure in the scandal, with her personal life becoming the subject of widespread discussion.

[דובר 2] (3:07 - 3:17)
So the Lewinsky scandal was a huge embarrassment to Hillary Clinton. She just found it a huge breach of trust, and it was a public humiliation.

[דובר 3] (3:18 - 3:22)
I want to say Hillary and I have been over there just laughing this up. We don't want this to ever end.

[דובר 1] (3:22 - 3:32)
She initially defended him, and later described the affair as a vast right-wing conspiracy. However, the scandal put a strain on the Clinton marriage.

[דובר 6] (3:32 - 3:39)
The stage is now set for a televised trial in the Senate. Mr. President commits the crimes of perjury, obstruction of justice.

[דובר 14] (3:39 - 3:41)
Deserving of punishment.

[דובר 1] (3:41 - 3:46)
As evidence grew and tapes were released, Bill admitted to the scandal.

[דובר 3] (3:47 - 4:10)
That is why I am speaking to you tonight. As you know, in a deposition in January, I was asked questions about my relationship with Monica Lewinsky. While my answers were legally accurate, I did not volunteer information.

Indeed, I did have a relationship with Miss Lewinsky that was not appropriate. Bill Clinton experienced the worst 24 hours of his political life.

[דובר 12] (4:10 - 4:12)
In fact, it was wrong.

[דובר 11] (4:12 - 4:14)
What will the French think?

[דובר 3] (4:14 - 4:24)
What will the British think? It constituted a critical lapse in judgment. These allegations are false.

For which I am solely and completely responsible.

[דובר 10] (4:27 - 4:40)
Had referenced the cover story that you and he had had, that perhaps you could say that you were coming to my office to deliver papers or to see Betty Curry. Is that right?

[דובר 2] (4:41 - 4:44)
Correct. That was from the entire relationship, that story.

[דובר 1] (4:45 - 4:57)
Bill Clinton's impeachment was an historic event that unfolded in the late 1990s, marking only the second time in U.S. history that a sitting president faced impeachment proceedings.

[דובר 5] (4:57 - 5:17)
The current estimate is that only about five Republicans in the House of Representatives are prepared to vote against impeachment. About the same number of Democrats will vote for it. So if those numbers don't change, Bill Clinton will become the first president in 130 years to be impeached, and the drama will move on to a trial in the Senate.

[דובר 1] (5:17 - 5:28)
In December 1998, the House of Representatives, led by Republicans, approved two articles of impeachment against Clinton, perjury and obstruction of justice.

[דובר 6] (5:28 - 5:42)
The stage is now set for a televised trial in the Senate with Monica Lewinsky giving evidence. If convicted, the president will be removed from office. That is unlikely, but after today, the White House is taking nothing for granted.

[דובר 9] (5:42 - 5:57)
Impeach the man. This is not only a disgrace to our country, but they fear for our national security. All the people in my district think that the president ought to stay in office.

They don't like the Ken Starr witch hunt against him, and they really think he's doing a good job as president, and they support him.

[דובר 6] (5:57 - 6:07)
Outside Congress, many hailed the impeachment. Bill Clinton's place in history now secure, charged with high crime after a year of high drama.

[דובר 4] (6:07 - 6:15)
Deserving of punishment and accountability, but not the nuclear weapon of throwing him out of office.

[דובר 15] (6:15 - 6:21)
He clearly has confessed to God, and we must assume that God has forgiven him. Why can't we forgive him?

[דובר 14] (6:21 - 6:29)
If the president commits the crimes of perjury and obstruction of justice and witness tampering, he should not be allowed to remain in office.

[דובר 8] (6:29 - 6:47)
The salacious allegations in this referral are simply intended to humiliate, embarrass, and politically damage the president. In short, this is personal and not impeachable.

[דובר 13] (6:47 - 6:58)
By the way, David Kendall is not the one who's going to determine what's impeachable and what isn't. It's the House of Representatives, and they can use almost any standard they want to to determine what is or is not impeachable.

[דובר 5] (7:00 - 7:15)
Just a mile from there, thousands have gathered to protest, not against the military involvement in Iraq, but against the imminent impeachment of the military's commander-in-chief. To the disgust of the Democrats, the impeachment debate will start tomorrow, while U.S. forces are still in action.

[דובר 11] (7:16 - 7:28)
What will the Russians think? What will the Chinese think? What will the French think?

What will the British think? What will anybody think? This is wrong, and it should not be happening.

[דובר 4] (7:28 - 7:49)
He obviously has been deeply humiliated and embarrassed in a personal sense with his family and friends and before the nation and the world. I don't think it can be called a victory of any sort. I do think the American people wisely and rightly recognized from the outset that this was a case that should not have been brought.

[דובר 1] (7:49 - 8:05)
On February 12th, 1999, Clinton was acquitted on both charges, with the perjury charge failing by a vote of 55 to 45, and the obstruction of justice charge by 50 to 50.

[דובר 2] (8:05 - 8:10)
But it did not pass in the Senate. And in fact, it actually backfired for the Republicans.

[דובר 4] (8:10 - 8:22)
In a curious way, the Republicans in Congress need it even more than he does. Their standing is at an all-time low. They are in great danger of becoming seen as solely as the party of impeachment.

[דובר 12] (8:23 - 8:33)
And independent counsel Kenneth Starr, also having off the weekend, must have wondered why with his report now public, the president's approval rating has climbed even higher.

[דובר 2] (8:34 - 8:55)
His approval rating after the impeachment hearings took place was at 70 percent. And it really didn't go well for the Republicans because they thought that I think the entire public would galvanize against him. When instead, they actually felt that this was an unnecessary use of taxpayer dollars.

[דובר 1] (8:55 - 9:06)
Clinton remained in office for the rest of his term. The impeachment did not result in his removal from the presidency. He now has less than half his second term to run.

[דובר 4] (9:06 - 9:32)
Is that time enough, do you think, now to do something significant domestically, perhaps even in foreign policy, too? Well, I think that in a curious way, there's a coming together of political incentives to get something meaningful done. The president obviously wants to do so to use the remainder of his term for productive purposes and to shift the focus of history off of this unfortunate incident.

[דובר 2] (9:32 - 10:11)
American citizens felt that, you know, the economy was doing well. In fact, there was some of the lowest unemployment levels that the U.S. has ever seen. The median income had had risen.

You had more U.S. homeowners than ever before. Inflation was in check. The economy appeared to be booming.

And many people attributed Bill Clinton and his policies to this economic boom. And they felt that this distraction of impeaching him over something that many people might have found morally reprehensible, but not something that merited impeaching him.

[דובר 1] (10:11 - 10:27)
The impeachment left a lasting impact on both Clinton's legacy and the political landscape. While Clinton's presidency is often remembered for economic prosperity, the scandal cast a shadow over his personal conduct.
